    "Applications in the cloud can be scaled in two ways, while taking advantage of autoscaling:\n",

In the CapEx model, companies pay for their infrastructure upfront costs. These costs can include servers, storage, networking, backup, personnel, etc.\n",

    "OpEx is money spent every day on operating expenses. As an on-going cost, Opex is associated with cloud services, usually assuming the form of a subscription, where customers pay for the product or service as they use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Opex offers several benefits, for example, customers can test the cloud services before committing (aka \"try-before-buy\"). Another benefit is to only pay for less or more resources when and for how long those are needed. As cloud services offer the possibility to delete a resource when a task is done, Opex is great for agile environmnets where demand is unpredictable."

    "Infrastructure-as-a-Service includes virtual machines, networking, load balancers, and firewalls, etc., generally everything that has a physical representation in the network and can be virtualized and offered as a service by the cloud provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cloud service model is the closest to managing physical servers. A cloud provider keeps the hardware up to date, but operating system maintenance and network configuration is left to the cloud tenant. For example, Azure virtual machines are fully operational virtual compute devices running in Microsoft's datacenters. An advantage of this cloud service model is rapid deployment of new compute devices. Setting up a new virtual machine is considerably faster than procuring, installing, and configuring a physical server.\n",

    "Platform-as-a-Service includes pre-built services that can be executed remotely, without the customers having access to the underlying hardware.\n",

The cloud provider manages the virtual machines and networking resources, and the cloud tenant deploys their applications into the managed hosting environment. For example, Azure App Services provides a managed hosting environment where developers can upload their web applications without having to deal with the physical hardware and software requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Software-as-a-Service is software installed in a cloud server that the customer can access remotely using a browser. When using SaaS, the customer is only allowed to access and change the software configuration, he is not allowed to upload new code or change the existing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this cloud service model, the cloud provider manages all aspects of the application environment, such as virtual machines, networking resources, data storage, and applications. The cloud tenant only needs to provide their data to the application managed by the cloud provider. For example, Office 365 provides a fully working version of Office that runs in the cloud. All that you need to do is create your content, and Office 365 takes care of everything else.\n",

When the virtual machine is added to an availability set, the virtual machine is assigned to an update domain and a fault domain. The reason of assigning the VM to an update domain is because only one update domain is updated at a time. The fault domains provide physical isolation hardware in the data center.\n",

The virtual machine is sandboxed from the rest of the system, meaning that the software inside a virtual machine can’t escape or tamper with the computer itself. This produces an ideal environment for testing other operating systems including beta releases, accessing virus-infected data, creating operating system backups, and running software or applications on operating systems they weren’t originally intended for.\n",

For servers, the multiple operating systems run side-by-side with a piece of software called a hypervisor to manage them, while desktop computers typical employ one operating system to run the other operating systems within its program windows. Each virtual machine provides its own virtual hardware, including CPUs, memory, hard drives, network interfaces, and other devices. The virtual hardware is then mapped to the real hardware on the physical machine which saves costs by reducing the need for physical hardware systems along with the associated maintenance costs that go with it, plus reduces power and cooling demand.\n",

    "Load balancing refers to evenly distributing load (incoming network traffic) across a group of backend resources or servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure Load Balancer operates at Layer 4 of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. It is the single point of contact for clients. Load balancer distributes inbound flows that arrive at the load balancer's front end to backend pool instances. These flows are according to configured load-balancing rules and health probes. The backend pool instances can be Azure Virtual Machines or instances in a virtual machine scale set.\n",

    "A public load balancer can provide outbound connections for virtual machines (VMs) inside users' virtual network. These connections are accomplished by translating their private IP addresses to public IP addresses. Public Load Balancers are used to load balance internet traffic to users' VMs.\n",

Traditional load balancers operate at the transport layer (OSI Layer 4 - TCP and UDP) and route traffic based on source IP address and port, to a destination IP address and port.\n",
    "\n",
    "Application Gateway can make routing decisions based on additional attributes of an HTTP request, for example, its URI path or Host headers. For example, traffic can be routed based on the incoming URL. So if \"/images\" is in the incoming URL, trafiic can be routed to a specific set of servers (known as a \"pool\") configured for images. If \"/video\" is in the URL, that traffic is routed to another pool that is optimized for videos. This type of routing is known as application layer (OSI Layer 7) load balancing.

Based on your routing method you can ensure that Front Door will route your client requests to the fastest and most available application backend. An application backend is any Internet-facing service hosted inside or outside of Azure. Front Door provides a range of traffic-routing methods and backend health monitoring options to suit different application needs and automatic failover scenarios. Similar to Traffic Manager, Front Door is resilient to failures, including failures to an entire Azure region."

    "If you only use a password to authenticate a user, it leaves an insecure vector for attack. If the password is weak or has been exposed elsewhere, is it really the user signing in with the username and password, or is it an attacker? When you require a second form of authentication, security is increased as this additional factor isn't something that's easy for an attacker to obtain or duplicate.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can set the lock level to CanNotDelete or ReadOnly. In the portal, the locks are called Delete and Read-only respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    " * CanNotDelete means authorized users can still read and modify a resource, but they can't delete the resource.\n",
    " * ReadOnly means authorized users can read a resource, but they can't delete or update the resource. Applying this lock is similar to restricting all authorized users to the permissions granted by the Reader role.\n",

    "When you apply a lock at a parent scope, all resources within that scope inherit the same lock. Even resources you add later inherit the lock from the parent. The most restrictive lock in the inheritance takes precedence.\n",

    "\n",
    "Resource Manager locks apply only to operations that happen in the management plane, which consists of operations sent to https://management.azure.com. The locks don't restrict how resources perform their own functions. Resource changes are restricted, but resource operations aren't restricted. For example, a ReadOnly lock on a SQL Database logical server prevents you from deleting or modifying the server. It doesn't prevent you from creating, updating, or deleting data in the databases on that server. Data transactions are permitted because those operations aren't sent to https://management.azure.com."

It also helps to bring your resources to compliance through bulk remediation for existing resources and automatic remediation for new resources.\n",

To simplify management, several business rules can be grouped together to form a policy initiative (sometimes called a policySet). Once your business rules have been formed, the policy definition or initiative is assigned to any scope of resources that Azure supports, such as management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, or individual resources. The assignment applies to all resources within the Resource Manager scope of that assignment. Subscopes can be excluded, if necessary. For more information, see Scope in Azure Policy.\n",
