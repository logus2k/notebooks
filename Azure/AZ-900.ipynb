    "\n",
    "A virtual machine is a computer file, typically called an image, that behaves like an actual computer. In other words, creating a computer within a computer. It runs in a window, much like any other program, giving the end user the same experience on a virtual machine as they would have on the host operating system itself. The virtual machine is sandboxed from the rest of the system, meaning that the software inside a virtual machine can’t escape or tamper with the computer itself. This produces an ideal environment for testing other operating systems including beta releases, accessing virus-infected data, creating operating system backups, and running software or applications on operating systems they weren’t originally intended for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple virtual machines can run simultaneously on the same physical computer. For servers, the multiple operating systems run side-by-side with a piece of software called a hypervisor to manage them, while desktop computers typical employ one operating system to run the other operating systems within its program windows. Each virtual machine provides its own virtual hardware, including CPUs, memory, hard drives, network interfaces, and other devices. The virtual hardware is then mapped to the real hardware on the physical machine which saves costs by reducing the need for physical hardware systems along with the associated maintenance costs that go with it, plus reduces power and cooling demand.\n",

    "Azure App Service is an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends. Users can develop in their favorite language, be it .NET, .NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python. Applications run and scale on both Windows and Linux-based environments. The Azure App Service is a Plaform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offering. With App Service, users have no access to the hardware.\n",

    "Containers are becoming the preferred way to package, deploy, and manage cloud applications. Azure Container Instances offers the fastest and simplest way to run a container in Azure, without having to manage any virtual machines and without having to adopt a higher-level service. ACI is a great solution for any scenario that can operate in isolated containers, including simple applications, task automation, and build jobs.\n",

    "Azure Kubernetes Service simplifies deploying a managed Kubernetes cluster in Azure by offloading the operational overhead to Azure. As a hosted Kubernetes service, Azure handles critical tasks, like health monitoring and maintenance. Since Kubernetes masters are managed by Azure, users only manage and maintain the agent nodes. Thus, AKS is free; users only pay for the agent nodes within their clusters, not for the masters.\n",

    " * Create a full desktop virtualization environment in their Azure subscriptions without having to run any additional gateway servers.\n",
    " * Publish as many host pools as needed to accommodate diverse workloads.\n",
    " * Bring their own images for production workloads or test from the Azure Gallery.\n",
    " * Reduce costs with pooled, multi-session resources. With the new Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session capability exclusive to Windows Virtual Desktop and Remote Desktop Session Host (RDSH) role on Windows Server, users can greatly reduce the number of virtual machines and operating system (OS) overhead while still providing the same resources.\n",

A VNet enables many types of resources, such as virtual machines, to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks. It is similar to a traditional network that users operate in their own data centers, but brings with it additional benefits of Azure's infrastructure such as scale, availability, and isolation.\n",

    "Azure VPN uses a Network Gateway to connect two networks as if they were on the same network. A VPN gateway is a specific type of virtual network gateway that is used to send encrypted traffic between an Azure virtual network and an on-premises location over the public Internet. The connectivity is secure and uses the industry-standard protocols Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) and Internet Key Exchange (IKE).\n",

    "Users can also use a VPN gateway to send encrypted traffic between Azure virtual networks over the Microsoft network. Each virtual network can have only one VPN gateway. However, users can create multiple connections to the same VPN gateway. When multiple connections to the same VPN gateway are created, all VPN tunnels share the available gateway bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Azure Express Route\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure ExpressRoute offers a fast and reliable connection to Azure with bandwidths up to 100 Gbps, which makes it excellent for scenarios like periodic data migration, replication for business continuity, disaster recovery, and other high-availability strategies. It can be a cost-effective option for transferring large amounts of data, such as datasets for high-performance computing applications, or moving large virtual machines between users' dev-test environments in an Azure virtual private cloud and their on-premises production environments.\n",
