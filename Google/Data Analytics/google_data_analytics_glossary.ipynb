    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis is the process used to make sense of the data collected. It means taking the right steps to proceed and think about your data in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of analysis is to identify trends and relationships within the data so that you can accurately answer the question you're asking.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four phases of analysis are:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. __Organize data__: It is super important that you keep your data organized throughout your analysis. How your data is classified and structured will impact your findings, whether you're working in a spreadsheet or a database. Most of the data you'll use in your analysis will be organized in tables.\n",
    " \n",
    " Tables help you organize similar kinds of data into categories and subject areas that you can focus on as you analyze. Each table then has several fields of data, like branch owner and the cost of repair parts. You can use these tables and fields to help you decide how to move forward with your analysis. The structure of this database can help you decide which data you need to pull to meet your objectives. For example, the total number of a particular brand of car sold, or a repair part for a specific make and model of a car at a certain branch.\n",
    "\n",
    " Tables also allow you to make decisions about data types. They help you to figure out what variables you need and the data type those variables should have.\n",
    " \n",
    " 2. __Format and adjust data__: formatting data streamlines things and saves time. Scrolling through hundreds of gifts can be time-consuming. Instead, you can adjust the data in a way that makes it easy to digest by filtering and sorting it.\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. __Get input from others__: When analyzing data, gaining input from others is important because it gives you a viewpoint you might not understand or have access to. On top of gaining input from other people, it's also important to seek out others' perspectives early. That way, if they predict any obstacles or challenges, you'll know beforehand. The people you'll look to for input don't have to be experts to be helpful. Sometimes all you need is for someone who's familiar with a topic or data you're considering.\n",
    " \n",
    " 4. __Transform data__: Transforming data means identifying relationships and patterns between the data, and making calculations based on the data you have."

    "# Analytical Skills\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Analytical skills are qualities and characteristics associated with using facts to solve problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there are a lot of aspects to analytical skills, it is possible to summarize on five essential points:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Curiosity\n",
    "\n",
    "Curiosity is all about wanting to learn something. Curious people usually seek out new challenges and experiences. This leads to knowledge. The very fact that you're here with me right now demonstrates that you have curiosity. That was an easy one.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding context\n",
    "\n",
    "Context is the condition in which something exists or happens. This can be a structure or an environment. Listening and trying to understand the full picture is critical. In your own life, you put things into context all the time. For example, think about your grocery list. If you group together items like flour, sugar, and yeast, that's you adding context to your groceries. This saves you time when you're at the baking aisle at the grocery store. Let's look at another example. Have you ever shuffled a deck of cards and noticed the joker? If you're playing a game that doesn't include jokers, identifying that card means you understand it's out of context. Remove it, and you're much more likely to play a successful game.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Having a technical mindset\n",
    "\n",
    "A technical mindset involves the ability to break things down into smaller steps or pieces and work with them in an orderly and logical way. For instance, when paying your bills, you probably already break down the process into smaller steps. Maybe you start by sorting them by the date they're due. Next, you might add them up and compare that amount to the balance in your bank account. This would help you see if you can pay your bills now, or if you should wait until the next paycheck. Finally, you'd pay them. When you take something that seems like a single task, like paying your bills, and break it into smaller steps with an orderly process, that's using a technical mindset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data design\n",
    "\n",
    "Data design is how you organize information. As a data analyst, design typically has to do with an actual database. But, again, the same skills can easily be applied to everyday life. For example, think about the way you organize the contacts in your phone. That's actually a type of data design. Maybe you list them by first name instead of last, or maybe you use email addresses instead of their names. What you're really doing is designing a clear, logical list that lets you call or text a contact in a quick and simple way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Data strategy is the management of the people, processes, and tools used in data analysis. You manage people by making sure they know how to use the right data to find solutions to the problem you're working on. For processes, it's about making sure the path to that solution is clear and accessible. For tools, you make sure the right technology is being used for the job. Imagine mowing a lawn. Step 1 would be reading the owner's manual for the mower. That's making sure the people involved, or you, in this example, know how to use the data available. The manual would instruct you to put on protective eyewear and closed-toe shoes. Then, it's on to step 2: making the process, the path, clear and accessible. This will involve you walking around the lawn, picking up large sticks or rocks that might get in your way. Finally, for step 3, you check the lawn mower, your tool, to make sure it has enough gas and oil, and is in working condition, so the lawn can be mown safely."

This could be anything from quantitative data or qualitative data. It could be cross-sectional, or points in time versus longitudinal over a long period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, the analysts needed to define what the project would look like and what would qualify as a successful result. To determine these things, they asked effective questions and collaborated with leaders and managers who were interested in the outcome of their people analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, as analysts in the Ask phase, we need do two things:\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Define the problem to be solved__\n",
    "\n",
    " Defining a problem means you look at the current state and identify how it's different from the ideal state. Usually there's an obstacle we need to get rid of or something wrong that needs to be fixed. For instance, a sports arena might want to reduce the time fans spend waiting in the ticket line. The obstacle is figuring out how to get the customers to their seats more quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Make sure that we fully understand stakeholder expectations__\n",
    "\n",
    " The first step here is to __determine who the stakeholders are__. That may include your manager, an executive sponsor, or your sales partners. There can be lots of stakeholders. But what they all have in common is that they help make decisions, influence actions and strategies, and have specific goals they want to meet. They also care about the project and that's why it's so important to understand their expectations. For instance, if your manager assigns you a data analysis project related to business risk, it would be smart to confirm whether they want to include all types of risks that could affect the company, or just risks related to weather such as hurricanes and tornadoes.\n",
    " \n",
    " __Communicating with your stakeholders__ is key in making sure you stay engaged and on track throughout the project. So as a data analyst, developing strong communication strategies is very important. This part of the ask phase helps you keep focused on the problem itself, not just its symptoms. The Five Whys are extremely helpful here.\n",

    " * Now that I’ve identified the issues, how can I help the stakeholders resolve their questions?\n",

    " 1. Who are the primary and secondary stakeholders?\n",

Also during this step, the analysts identified what data they needed to achieve the successful result they identified in the previous step - in this case, the analysts chose to gather the data from a survey of new employees. They identified specific questions to ask about employee satisfaction with different business processes, such as hiring, onboarding, and compensation. Rules were established for who would have access to the data collected, what specific information would be gathered, and how best to present the data visually. The analysts brainstormed possible project - and data-related issues and how to avoid them.\n",

In order to maintain confidentiality and protect and store the data effectively, access was restricted to a limited number of analysts. Collecting and using data ethically is one of the responsibilities of a data analyst. Then the data was cleaned up to make sure it was complete, correct, and relevant, and uploaded to an internal data warehouse for an additional layer of security.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the Process phase, data analysts find and eliminate any errors and inaccuracies that can get in the way of results. This usually means cleaning data, transforming it into a more useful format, combining two or more datasets to make information more complete and removing outliers, which are any data points that could skew the information. After that, you'll learn how to check the data you prepare to make sure it's complete and correct. This phase is all about getting the details right. So you'll also fix typos, inconsistencies, or missing and inaccurate data. To top it off, you'll gain strategies for verifying and sharing your data cleansing with stakeholders.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Mistakes To Avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "### Not checking for spelling errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Misspellings can be as simple as typing or input errors. Most of the time the wrong spelling or common grammatical errors can be detected, but it gets harder with things like names or addresses. For example, if you are working with a spreadsheet table of customer data, you might come across a customer named “John” whose name has been input incorrectly as “Jon” in some places. The spreadsheet’s spellcheck probably won’t flag this, so if you don’t double-check for spelling errors and catch this, your analysis will have mistakes in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forgetting to document errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Documenting your errors can be a big time saver, as it helps you avoid those errors in the future by showing you how you resolved them. For example, let’s say you find an error in a formula in your spreadsheet. You discover that some of the dates in one of your columns haven’t been formatted correctly. If you make a note of this fix, you can reference it the next time your formula is broken, and get a head start on troubleshooting. Documenting your errors also helps you keep track of changes in your work, so that you can backtrack if a fix didn’t work. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Not checking for misfielded values\n",
    "\n",
    "A misfielded value happens when the values are entered into the wrong field. These values might still be formatted correctly, which makes them harder to catch if you aren’t careful. For example, you might have a dataset with columns for cities and countries. These are the same type of data, so they are easy to mix up. But if you were trying to find all of the instances of Spain in the country column, and Spain had mistakenly been entered into the city column, you would miss key data points. Making sure your data has been entered correctly is key to accurate, complete analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Overlooking missing values\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing values in your dataset can create errors and give you inaccurate conclusions. For example, if you were trying to get the total number of sales from the last three months, but a week of transactions were missing, your calculations would be inaccurate.  As a best practice, try to keep your data as clean as possible by maintaining completeness and consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Only looking at a subset of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to think about all of the relevant data when you are cleaning. This helps make sure you understand the whole story the data is telling, and that you are paying attention to all possible errors. For example, if you are working with data about bird migration patterns from different sources, but you only clean one source, you might not realize that some of the data is being repeated. This will cause problems in your analysis later on. If you want to avoid common errors like duplicates, each field of your data requires equal attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Losing track of business objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are cleaning data, you might make new and interesting discoveries about your dataset-- but you don’t want those discoveries to distract you from the task at hand. For example, if you were working with weather data to find the average number of rainy days in your city, you might notice some interesting patterns about snowfall, too. That is really interesting, but it isn’t related to the question you are trying to answer right now. Being curious is great! But try not to let it distract you from the task at hand.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Not fixing the source of the error\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixing the error itself is important. But if that error is actually part of a bigger problem, you need to find the source of the issue. Otherwise, you will have to keep fixing that same error over and over again. For example, imagine you have a team spreadsheet that tracks everyone’s progress. The table keeps breaking because different people are entering different values. You can keep fixing all of these problems one by one, or you can set up your table to streamline data entry so everyone is on the same page. Addressing the source of the errors in your data will save you a lot of time in the long run. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Not analyzing the system prior to data cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to clean our data and avoid future errors, we need to understand the root cause of your dirty data. Imagine you are an auto mechanic. You would find the cause of the problem before you started fixing the car, right? The same goes for data. First, you figure out where the errors come from. Maybe it is from a data entry error, not setting up a spell check, lack of formats, or from duplicates. Then, once you understand where bad data comes from, you can control it and keep your data clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Not backing up your data prior to data cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "It is always good to be proactive and create your data backup before you start your data clean-up. If your program crashes, or if your changes cause a problem in your dataset, you can always go back to the saved version and restore it. The simple procedure of backing up your data can save you hours of work-- and most importantly, a headache. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Not accounting for data cleaning in your deadlines/process\n",
    "\n",
    "All good things take time, and that includes data cleaning. It is important to keep that in mind when going through your process and looking at your deadlines. When you set aside time for data cleaning, it helps you get a more accurate estimate for ETAs for stakeholders, and can help you know when to request an adjusted ETA.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Problems To Correct\n",
    "\n",
    " * Sources of errors: Did you use the right tools and functions to find the source of the errors in your dataset?\n",

    " * Mismatched data types: Did you check that numeric, date, and string data are typecast correctly?\n",
    " * Messy (inconsistent) strings: Did you make sure that all of your strings are consistent and meaningful?\n",
    " * Messy (inconsistent) date formats: Did you format the dates consistently throughout your dataset?\n",
    " * Misleading variable labels (columns): Did you name your columns meaningfully?\n",
    " * Truncated data: Did you check for truncated or missing data that needs correction?\n",
    " * Business Logic: Did you check that the data makes sense given your knowledge of the business?\n",

    "  * How much data to collect: if you are collecting your own data, make reasonable decisions about sample size. A random sample from existing data might be fine for some projects.

    " * Choose data sources: if you don’t collect the data using your own resources (first-party data), you might get data from second-party or third-party data providers.

Data analysts have to find a way to balance data security with their actual analysis needs. This can be tricky, as we want to keep our data safe and secure, but we also want to use it as soon as possible so that we can make meaningful and timely observations. There are a few security measures that can help companies do just that.\n",

This algorithm is saved as a “key” which can be used to reverse the encryption, so that if you have the key, you can still use the data in its original form.  \n",

    " * __Tokenization__: replaces the data elements you want to protect with randomly generated data referred to as a “token.” The original data is stored in a separate location and mapped to the tokens. To access the complete original data, the user or application needs to have permission to use the tokenized data and the token mapping. This means that even if the tokenized data is hacked, the original data is still safe and secure in a separate location. \n",

    "\n",
    "Data storytelling is communicating the meaning of a dataset with visuals and a narrative that are customized for each particular audience. You need to think about who will be looking at the data and what they need from it and how often they'll use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three data storytelling steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Engage your audience__: Engagement is capturing and holding someone's interest and attention. When your audience is engaged, you're much more likely to connect with them and convince them to see the same story you see. Every data story should start with audience engagement, all successful storytellers consider who's listening first.\n",
    "\n",
    " To successfully engage your audience, you should ask these questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * What role does this audience play?\n",
    "   * What is their stake in the project?\n",
    "   * What do they hope to get from the data insights?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Create compelling visuals__: show the story of your data, not just tell it. Visuals should take your audience on a journey of how the data changed over time or highlight the meaning behind the numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Tell the story in an interesting narrative__: A narrative has a beginning, a middle, and an end. It should connect the data you've collected to the project objective and clearly explain important insights from your analysis. To do this, it's important that your data storytelling is organized and concise.\n",

    "\n",
    "Basically, an effective data visualization should lead viewers to reach the same conclusion you did, but much more quickly. The following data visualization was made by David McCandless, a well-known data journalist. His graphic is arranged in a four-part Venn diagram, which tells us that all four elements are needed for a successful visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. __Information (data)__: The information or data that you are trying to convey is a key building block for your data visualization. Without information or data, you cannot communicate your findings successfully. More specifically, the _conclusion_ you have drawn from the data, which you are aiming to communicate with visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. __Story (concept)__: A story allows you to share your data in meaningful and interesting ways. Without a story, your visualization is informative, but not really inspiring. You need to deliver a clear and compelling narrative or concept that adds _meaning_ to the data, and makes it _interesting_.\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. __Goal (function)__: The goal is a specific objective or function for the visual that makes the data _usable_ and _useful_. This is what you are trying to achieve with your visualization. Without a goal, your visualization might still be informative, but can’t generate actionable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    " 4. __Visual form (metaphor)__: An effective use of metaphor or visual expression that creates both _beauty_ and _structure_. Without visual form, your data is not visualized yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "![What Makes A Good Visualization](images\\visualization_elements.png \"What Makes A Good Visualization\")\n",
    "\n",
    "All four elements in the graphic seem essential. With just two, you get something prototypical and sketchy – which is okay if you are at an early stage. With three, the end result is strangely lacking.\n",
    "\n",
    "The McCandless method involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduce the graphic by name.\n",
    "2. Answer obvious questions before they are asked.\n",
    "3. State the insight of your graphic.\n",
    "4. Call out data to support that insight.\n",
    "5. Tell your audience why it matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "One useful way of approaching this framework is to notice the parts of the graphic where there is incomplete overlap between all four elements. For example, visual form without a goal, story, or data could be a sketch or even art. Data plus visual form without a goal or function is eye candy. Data with a goal but no story or visual form is boring. All four elements need to be at work to create an effective visual.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Good Data Visualization Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "* Five-second rule: A data visualization should be _clear, effective, and convincing_ enough to be absorbed in 5 seconds or less.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Graphs and charts should use a _diverging color palette_ to show contrast between elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Should align with _audience expectations_ and _cultural conventions_. For example, if the majority of your audience associates green with a positive concept and red with a negative one, your visualization should reflect this.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Should use as _few labels_ as it takes to make sense. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Having too many labels makes your graph or chart too busy, it takes up too much space, and it prevents the labels from being shown clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "These design principles are important to your work as a data analyst because they help you make sure that you are creating visualizations that communicate your data effectively to your audience.

    "## Best Practices\n",

    "\n",
    " * Your audience should know what they are observing within five seconds of being shown it--visuals should be clear and easy to follow.\n",
    " * In the five seconds after that, your audience should understand the conclusion your visualization is making--even if they aren’t familiar with the research you’ve been doing. \n",
    " * As a general rule, as long as it’s not misleading, you should visually represent only the data that your audience needs in order to understand your findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dashboards\n",
    "\n",
    "When monitoring trends, sometimes the data changes too quickly or comes from too many sources to be captured accurately in charts and graphs. In this case, a dashboard is the best way to visualize data from many sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of dashboards used to visualize trends (and their likely goals):\n",
    "\n",
    " * Cash flow and budgeting dashboard for a small business (to help the business stay on track with its budget and expenses).\n",
    " * Company-wide dashboard (to help departments with metrics and benchmark against other departments).\n",

Depending on your type of data, a bar chart can even be appropriate in this case. For example, if you have data pertaining to the height of a group of students, you will want to use a histogram to visualize how many students there are in each height range:\n",

    "\n",
    " * __Are there multiple data sets?__ For cases dealing with more than one set of data, consider a line or pie chart for accurate representation of your data. A line chart will connect multiple data sets over a single, continuous line, showing how numbers have changed over time. A pie chart is good for dividing a whole into multiple categories or parts. An example of this is when you are measuring quarterly sales figures of your company. Below are examples of this data plotted on both a line and pie chart:\n",

If, for example, you are measuring the number of visitors to NYC over the past 6 months, the data would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    " ![Decision Tree Example 4](images\\decision_tree_example_4.png \"Decision Tree Example 4\")\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Do relationships between the data need to be shown?__ When you have two variables for one set of data, it is important to point out how one affects the other. Variables that pair well together are best plotted on a scatter plot. However, if there are too many data points, the relationship between variables can be obscured so a heat map can be a better representation in that case. If you are measuring the population of people across all 50 states in the United States, your data points would consist of millions so you would use a heat map. If you are simply trying to show the relationship between the number of hours spent studying and its effects on grades, your data would look like this:\n",

    "## Don't miss misaligned data\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're collecting data from other teams and using existing spreadsheets, it is good to keep in mind that people use different business rules. So one team might define and measure things in a completely different way than another. For example, if a metric is the total number of trainees in a certificate program, you could have one team that counts every person who registered for the training, and another team that counts only the people who completed the program. In cases like these, establishing how to measure things early on standardizes the data across the board for greater reliability and accuracy. This will make sure comparisons between teams are meaningful and insightful.\n",

    "## Deal with dirty data\n",
    "\n",
    "Dirty data refers to data that contains errors. Dirty data can lead to productivity loss, unnecessary spending, and unwise decision-making. A good data cleaning effort can help you avoid this. As a quick reminder, data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset. When you find and fix the errors - while tracking the changes you made - you can avoid a data disaster. You will learn how to clean data later in the training.\n",

    "## Tell A Clear Story\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some of the best practices for good data storytelling: \n",
    "\n",
    " * Compare the same types of data: Data can get mixed up when you chart it for visualization. Be sure to compare the same types of data and double check that any segments in your chart definitely display different metrics. \n",
    "\n",
    " * Visualize with care: A 0.01% drop in a score can look huge if you zoom in close enough. To make sure your audience sees the full story clearly, it is a good idea to set your Y-axis to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Leave out needless graphs: If a table can show your story at a glance, stick with the table instead of a pie chart or a graph. Your busy audience will appreciate the clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Test for statistical significance: Sometimes two datasets will look different, but you will need a way to test whether the difference is real and important. So remember to run statistical tests to see how much confidence you can place in that difference.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Pay attention to sample size: Gather lots of data. If a sample size is small, a few unusual responses can skew the results. If you find that you have too little data, be careful about using it to form judgments. Look for opportunities to collect more data, then chart those trends over longer periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Be The Judge\n",
    "\n",
    "In any organization, a big part of a data analyst’s role is making sound judgments. When you know the limitations of your data, you can make judgment calls that help people make better decisions supported by the data. Data is an extremely powerful tool for decision-making, but if it is incomplete, misaligned, or hasn’t been cleaned, then it can be misleading. Take the necessary steps to make sure that your data is complete and consistent. Clean the data before you begin your analysis to save yourself and possibly others a great amount of time and effort."

Also, try to keep the number of people at your meeting under 10 if possible. More people makes it hard to have a collaborative discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are best practices to make sure your meetings are a success. This applies to both meetings you lead and ones you attend:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Come prepared: bring what you need, and read the meeting agenda. If you are presenting, prepare your notes and presentations, know what you are going to talk about, and be ready to answer questions.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Be on time: it's important to respect your team members' time. The best way to do this is to come to meetings on time. If you're leading the meeting, show up early and set up beforehand so you're ready to start when people arrive. You can do the same thing for online meetings.\n",
    " \n",
    " * Pay attention: staying focused and attentive during a meeting is another great way to respect your team members' time. You don't want to miss something important because you were distracted by something else during a presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Ask questions: Paying attention also means asking questions when you need clarification, or if you think there may be a problem with a project plan. Don't be afraid to reach out after a meeting. If you didn't get to ask your question, follow up with the group afterwards and get your answer.\n",
    "\n",

    "Try to make sure you give other team members a chance to talk and always let them finish their thought before you start speaking. Everyone who is attending your meeting should be giving their input. Provide opportunities for people to speak up, ask questions, call for expertise, and solicit their feedback.

    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "There are helpful questions to ask yourself when applying best practices to create a presentation. For example, do you:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use an attention-grabbing opening?\n",
    "* Start with broad ideas and later talk about specific details?\n",
    "* Speak in short sentences?\n",
    "* Pause for five seconds after showing a data visualization?\n",
    "* Pause intentionally at certain points?\n",
    "* Keep the pitch of your voice level?\n",
    "* Stand still and move with purpose?\n",
    "* Maintain good posture?\n",
    "* Look at your audience (or camera) while speaking?\n",
    "* Keep your message concise?\n",
    "* End by explaining why the data analysis matters?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Task\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of a business task: Let's say we're working with a grocery store chain, and they have asked us to identify trends and online searches for avocados to help them make seasonal stocking decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Online Avocado Searches](images\\avocado_searches.png \"Online Avocado Searches\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Good Presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "A good presentation logically guides the audience through the data – from the objectives at the beginning all the way to the conclusions at the end. Data visualizations are introduced using a common theme and are thoughtfully placed before each conclusion. A good presentation gives people in the audience the facts and data, helps them understand what the data means, and provides takeaways about how they can use their understanding to make a change or do some good.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are common best practices when creating a good presentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Title and date the presentation was last updated.\n",
    "* Flow or table of contents.\n",
    "* Transition slides.\n",
    "* Visual introduction to the data (also used as a repeated theme).\n",
    "* Animated bullet points.\n",
    "* Annotations on top of visuals.\n",
    "* Logic and progression.\n",
    "* Limitations to the data (caveats) - what the data can’t tell you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Messy Presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "The main problem with a messy presentation is the lack of a logical flow. The data visualizations are hard to understand and appear without any introduction or explanation. The audience will have no sense of what they are looking at and why. When people in the audience have to figure out what the data means without any help, they can end up being lost, confused, and unclear about any actions they need to take.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are common problems found in a messy presentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* No story or logical flow.\n",
    "* No titles.\n",
    "* Too much text.\n",
    "* Inconsistent format (no theme).\n",
    "* Hard to understand.\n",
    "* No recommendation or conclusion at the end."

    "# Principles Of Design\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter how complex your analysis is, your audience will only care about what's in front of them and how easy they can understand it. Being a data analyst means learning to think in a lot of different ways. As you complete your analysis, you'll have to decide which visualization serve your needs and your audiences needs for each task.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are nine basic principles of design that data analysts should think about when building their visualizations. These principles can help guide you as you create effective and interesting visualizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Principles Of Design](images\\principles_of_design.png \"Principles Of Design\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Balance\n",
    "\n",
    "The design of a data visualization is balanced when the key visual elements, like color and shape, are distributed evenly. This doesn’t mean that you need complete symmetry, but your visualization shouldn’t have one side distracting from the other. If your data visualization is balanced, this could mean that the lines used to create the graphics are similar in length on both sides, or that the space between objects is equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This column chart is balanced; even though the columns are different heights and the chart isn’t symmetrical, the colors, width, and spacing of the columns keep this data visualization balanced. The colors provide sufficient contrast to each other so that you can pay attention to both the motivation level and the energy level displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Principles Of Design - Balance](images\\balance.png \"Principles Of Design - Balance\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Emphasis\n",
    "\n",
    "Your data visualization should have a focal point, so that your audience knows where to concentrate. In other words, your visualizations should emphasize the most important data so that users recognize it first. Using color and value is one effective way to make this happen. By using contrasting colors, you can make certain that graphic elements—and the data shown in those elements—stand out.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This heat map visualization uses colors and value intensity to emphasize the states where search interest is highest. You can visually identify the increase in the search over time from low interest to high interest. This way, you are able to quickly grasp the key idea being presented without knowing the specific data values.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Principles Of Design - Emphasis](images\\emphasis.png \"Principles Of Design - Emphasis\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Movement\n",
    "\n",
    "Movement can refer to the path the viewer’s eye travels as they look at a data visualization, or literal movement created by animations. Movement in data visualization should mimic the way people usually read. You can use lines and colors to pull the viewer’s attention across the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the average line in this combo chart draws your attention from left to right. Even though this example isn’t moving, it still uses the movement principle to guide viewers’ understanding of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Principles Of Design - Movement](images\\movement.png \"Principles Of Design - Movement\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use similar shapes and colors to create patterns in your data visualization. This can be useful in a lot of different ways. For example, you can use patterns to highlight similarities between different data sets, or break up a pattern with a unique shape, color, or line to create more emphasis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The different colored categories of this stacked column chart are a consistent pattern that makes it easier to compare book sales by genre in each column. Notice in the chart that the Fantasy & Sci Fi category (royal blue) is increasing over time even as the general category (green) is staying about the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Principles Of Design - Pattern](images\\pattern.png \"Principles Of Design - Pattern\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Repetition\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeating chart types, shapes, or colors adds to the effectiveness of your visualization. Think about the book sales chart from the previous example: the repetition of the colors helps the audience understand that there are distinct sets of data. You may notice this repetition in all of the examples we have reviewed so far. Take some time to review each of the previous examples and notice the elements that are repeated to create a meaningful visual story.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Proportion\n",
    "\n",
    "Proportion is another way that you can demonstrate the importance of certain data. Using various colors and sizes helps demonstrate that you are calling attention to a specific visual over others. If you make one chart in a dashboard larger than the others, then you are calling attention to it. It is important to make sure that each chart accurately reflects and visualizes the relationship among the values in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "In this dashboard, the slice sizes and colors of the pie chart compared to the data in the table help make the number of donuts eaten by each person the focal point. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Principles Of Design - Proportion](images\\proportion.png \"Principles Of Design - Proportion\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Rhythm\n",
    "\n",
    "This refers to creating a sense of movement or flow in your visualization. Rhythm is closely tied to the movement principle. If your finished design doesn’t successfully create a flow, you might want to rearrange some of the elements to improve the rhythm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Variety\n",
    "\n",
    "Your visualizations should have some variety in the chart types, lines, shapes, colors, and values you use. Variety keeps the audience engaged. But it is good to find balance since too much variety can confuse people. The variety you include should make your dashboards and other visualizations feel interesting and unified.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Unity\n",
    "\n",
    "The last principle is unity. This means that your final data visualization should be cohesive. If the visual is disjointed or not well organized, it will be confusing and overwhelming. "

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "A company that wants to know the best advertising method to bring in new customers is an example of a problem requiring analysts to make predictions. Analysts with data on location, type of media, and number of new customers acquired as a result of past ads can't guarantee future results, but they can help predict the best placement of advertising to reach the target audience.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Categorizing things\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, how to improve customer satisfaction levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a problem requiring analysts to categorize things is a company's goal to improve customer satisfaction. Analysts might classify customer service calls based on certain keywords or scores. This could help identify top-performing customer service representatives or help correlate certain actions taken with higher customer satisfaction scores.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Spotting something unusual\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, how a smart watch can find a peak in a resting heartbeat rate of a person.\n",
    "\n",
    "A company that sells smart watches that help people monitor their health would be interested in designing their software to spot something unusual. Analysts who have analyzed aggregated health data can help product developers determine the right algorithms to spot and set off alarms when certain data doesn't trend normally.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Identifying themes\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, how to improve a coffee maker customers' interaction with their products.\n",
    "\n",
    "User experience (UX) designers might rely on analysts to analyze user interaction data. Similar to problems that require analysts to categorize things, usability improvement projects might require analysts to identify themes to help prioritize the right product features for improvement. Themes are most often used to help researchers explore certain aspects of data. In a user study, user beliefs, practices, and needs are examples of themes. \n",
    "\n",
    "By now you might be wondering if there is a difference between categorizing things and identifying themes, The best way to think about it is this: Categorizing things involves assigning items to categories. Identifying themes takes those categories a step further by grouping them into broader themes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discovering connections\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, how to reduce wait time of truck drivers when they pick up a shipment.\n",
    "\n",
    "A third-party logistics company working with another company to get shipments delivered to customers on time is a problem requiring analysts to discover connections. By analyzing the wait times at shipping hubs, analysts can determine the appropriate schedule changes to increase the number of on-time deliveries. \n",
    " \n",
    "## Finding patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, how to stop machines from breaking down by generating insights on what led to the breakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimizing downtime caused by machine failure is an example of a problem requiring analysts to find patterns in data. For example, by analyzing maintenance data, they might discover that most failures happen if regular maintenance is delayed by more than a 15-day window. "
