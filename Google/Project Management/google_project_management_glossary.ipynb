    "Your project’s success depends on the adoption and acceptance of your project—whether that entails the launch of a new external tool or a process that will change operations at a production facility. In both cases, the greatest impact of the change will be on the people who use and interact with the product or process that is changing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Change management is a major undertaking and a project in and of itself. When it comes to change management, you may not always be responsible for leading and planning the entire end-to-end process. There will be times when your manager, a team member, or another senior leader might be responsible for taking on that transition and successfully implementing the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a project manager, you can think of change management as necessary for the successful outcome of your project. Both change management and project management aim to increase the likelihood of project success. They also incorporate tools and processes to accomplish that goal. The most effective way to achieve a project goal is to integrate project management and change management, and it is your responsibility as a project manager to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Participating in change management involves being empathetic to the challenges of the change management process and supporting necessary changes throughout the project lifecycle can help you support the process in subtle ways.\n",

    "Each organization is governed by its own set of standards and practices that direct and control its actions. Those standards and practices are called corporate governance, and they will influence your projects. Corporate governance is the framework by which an organization achieves its goals and objectives. Corporate governance is also a way to balance the requirements of the various corporate entities, such as stakeholders, management, and customers. Corporate governance affects every part of an organization, including action plans, internal and external controls, and performance measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Governance and change management go hand-in-hand. To successfully implement change management, it is essential that you understand the structure and culture of the organization. Effective governance in change management provides clearly defined roles and responsibilities during change. This enables the people within the organization to have a precise understanding of who makes decisions and of the relationship between those managing and participating in the change management process. \n",

    "Another example of governance within an organization is the creation and use of steering committees. Steering committees decide on the priorities of an organization and manage the general course of its operations.

    "\n",
    "A cost-benefit analysis can minimize risks and maximize gains for projects and organizations. It can help you communicate clearly with stakeholders and executives and keep your project on track. Because this type of analysis uses objective data, it can help reduce biases and keep stakeholder self-interest from influencing decisions. \n",

However, it is also important to protect your team from constant change and rework. A good way to do this is by documenting the initial expectations of the project and clearly identifying the changes being requested.

    "\n",
    "Lean methodology is often referred to as Lean Manufacturing because it originated in the manufacturing world. The main principle in Lean methodology is the removal of waste within an operation. By optimizing process steps and eliminating waste, only value is added at each phase of production.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, the Lean Manufacturing methodology recognizes eight types of waste within an operation: defects, excess processing, overproduction, waiting, inventory, transportation, motion, and non-utilized talent. In the manufacturing industry, these types of waste are often attributed to issues such as: \n",
    "\n",
    " * Lack of proper documentation\n",
    " * Lack of process standards\n",
    " * Not understanding the customers’ needs\n",
    " * Lack of effective communication\n",
    " * Lack of process control\n",
    " * Inefficient process design\n",
    " * Failures of management\n",
    "\n",
    "These same issues create waste in project management. \n",
    "\n",
    "Implement Lean project management when you want to use limited resources, reduce waste, and streamline processes to gain maximum benefits. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can achieve this by using the pillars of the Lean 5S quality tool. The term 5S refers to the five pillars that are required for good housekeeping: sort, set in order, shine, standardize, and sustain. Implementing the 5S method means cleaning up and organizing the workplace to achieve the smallest amount of wasted time and material. The 5S method includes these five steps: \n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Sort: Remove all items not needed for current production operations and leave only the bare essentials. \n",
    " 2. Set in order: Arrange needed items so that they are easy to use. Label items so that anyone can find them or put them away. \n",
    " 3. Shine: Keep everything in the correct place. Clean your workspace every day.\n",
    " 4. Standardize: Perform the process in the same way every time. \n",
    " 5. Sustain: Make a habit of maintaining correct procedures and instill this discipline in your team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the Lean methodology, 5S helps you boost performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "The final concept of Lean uses a Kanban scheduling system to manage production. The Kanban scheduling system, or Kanban board, is a visualization tool that enables you to optimize the flow of your team’s work. It gives the team a visual display to identify what needs to be done and when.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kanban board uses cards that are moved from left to right to show progress and help your team coordinate the work.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Six Sigma\n",
    "\n",
    "Six Sigma is a methodology used to reduce variations by ensuring that quality processes are followed every time. The term “Six Sigma” originates from statistics and generally means that items or processes should have $99.9996$% quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The seven key principles of Six Sigma are:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Always focus on the customer.\n",
    " 2. Identify and understand how the work gets done. Understand how work really happens.\n",
    " 3. Make your processes flow smoothly.\n",
    " 4. Reduce waste and concentrate on value.\n",
    " 5. Stop defects by removing variation.\n",
    " 6. Involve and collaborate with your team.\n",
    " 7. Approach improvement activity in a systematic way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this methodology to find aspects of the product or process that are measurable like time, cost, or quantity. Then inspect that measurable item and reject any products that do not meet the Six Sigma standard. Any process that created unacceptable products has to be improved upon.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Lean Six Sigma\n",
    "\n",
    "After both Lean and Six Sigma were put into practice, it was discovered that the two methodologies could be combined to increase benefits. The tools used in Lean, such as Kanban boards and 5S, build quality in processes from the beginning. Products developed using Lean methods are then inspected or tested using Six Sigma standards. The products that do not meet these standards are rejected. \n",
    "\n",
    "The largest difference between these methodologies is that Lean streamlines processes while Six Sigma reduces variation in products by building in quality from the beginning and inspecting products to ensure quality standards are met. You may find that one of these two methods—or using them both together—can improve the efficiency of your projects."

    "# Objectives And Key Results (OKR)\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Objectives and key results combine a goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Company-wide OKRs are used to set an ultimate goal for an entire organization, while team, department, and project-level OKRs describe the focused results each group will need to achieve in order to support the organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a project manager, OKRs can help you expand upon project goals and further clarify the deliverables you’ll need from the project to accomplish those goals. Project-level OKRs help establish the appropriate scope for your team so that you can say “no” to requests that may get in the way of them meeting their objectives. You can also create and use project-level OKRs to help motivate your team since OKRs are intended to challenge you to push past what’s easily achievable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective objectives are:\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Aspirational__: Is the objective challenging and inspiring?\n",
    " * __Aligned with company goals__: Does the objective support company and/or departmental OKRs?\n",
    " * __Action-oriented__: Does the objective motivate the team to take initiative?\n",
    " * __Concrete__: Can the project team easily grasp the objective?\n",
    " * __Significant__: Will achieving the objective make a meaningful impact or change from where you are currently?\n",
    "\n",
    "Each key result should address the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Does the key result help define success for your team?\n",
    " * Can it be measured to prove that you’ve achieved your objective?\n",
    " * Is it specific and time-bound?\n",
    " * Is it ambitious yet realistic?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some best practices to keep in mind when writing OKRs:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Think of your objectives as being motivational and inspiring and your key results as being tactical and specific. The objective describes what you want to do and the key results describe how you’ll know you did it. \n",
    " * As a general rule, try to develop around 2-3 key results for each objective.\n",
    " * Be sure to document your OKRs and link to them in your project plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "## OKRs vs SMART goals\n",
    "\n",
    "In OKRs, the \"objectives\" provide general, inspirational aims, while the \"key results\" detail the time-based metrics by which you gauge success. OKRs are typically both less specific and more aspirational than SMART goals, and as such, they often encourage the journey toward cultural change or a breakthrough development.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, SMART goals tend to measure a single metric, such as profitability or quality. These goals focus and track discrete individual efforts, but can still move a business or an individual forward. Sometimes, management will write and cascade SMART goals throughout the organization to ensure the quality and consistency of results. \n",
    "\n",
    "SMART goals are also frequently tied to compensation, whereas compensation is gauged separately from OKR achievement to encourage experimentation or a useful fail (wherein a team may grow capabilities but not fully achieve an aspirational goal).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Communicating and tracking OKRs\n",
    "\n",
    "Conducting regular check-ins and actively tracking progress with your team can help ensure that objectives are being met and that any issues are resolved as soon as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Share your OKRs with your team. Once you’ve created OKRs for your project, it’s important to communicate them to your team so that everyone knows how to focus and align their efforts. You can do this by sharing a digital document, presenting them in a meeting, or adding them to an internal website. OKRs can help your project team stick to its goals, monitor which are falling short, and be continuously motivated to meet project objectives. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assign owners. Assign an owner to every key result so that everybody knows who’s responsible for what. This helps add clarity and increases accountability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measuring progress\n",
    "\n",
    "Measuring your OKRs is an important part of tracking and sharing your progress. One shortcut to determining the status of a project is to score or grade your OKRs. While scores or grades don’t provide a complete assessment of a project’s success, they’re helpful tools for determining how close you came to achieving your objectives. You can then share your OKR scores with project stakeholders and team members as part of your overall project updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are recommended guidelines you can follow:\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Determine how you will score your OKRs__: OKRs can be scored in different ways. You can score based on a percentage of the objective completed, the completion of certain milestones, or a scale of 1 to 10, for example. You can also use a \"traffic light\" scoring approach, where red means you didn’t make any progress, yellow means you made some progress, and green means you completed your objective.\n",
    "\n",
    " The simplest approach to scoring OKRs is the \"yes/no\" method, with \"yes\" meaning you achieved your objective and \"no\" meaning you didn’t. Using this approach, a key result such as \"Launch a new widget marketing campaign\" might be graded a 1 or 0 depending on whether it was launched (1) or not (0). \n",
    "\n",
    " A more advanced scoring approach is to grade your key results on a scale. With this method, if a key result was to \"Launch six new features\" and only three new features were launched, the OKR might be graded 0.5. Generally, if the KR helped you achieve the objective, your OKR should receive a higher score; if it didn't, your OKR should receive a lower score. \n",
    "\n",
    " At Google, OKRs are usually graded on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0, with 1.0 meaning the objective was fully achieved. Each individual key result is graded and then the grades are averaged to determine the score for that OKR.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Set your scoring expectations__: With Google’s 0.0–1.0 scale, the expectation is to set ambitious OKRs and aim to achieve an average of at least 0.6 to 0.7 across all OKRs. For OKRs graded according to percentage achieved, the sweet spot is somewhere in the 60–70% range. Scoring lower may mean the team is not achieving what it could be. Scoring higher may mean the aspirational goals are not being set high enough. \n",
    "\n",
    " * __Schedule checkpoints__: It’s important to regularly communicate the status of project OKRs with your team and senior managers. For example, it can be helpful to have monthly check-ins on the progress of OKRs to give both individuals and your team a sense of where they are. Typically, at the end of the quarter, you’ll grade each of your OKRs to evaluate how well the team did to achieve its goals."

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Organizational culture is the values employees share, as well as the organization's values, mission, and history. It can be though of as the organization's personality.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a project manager, it is important to understand your company’s culture, especially because it could affect the projects you work on. Some aspects of an organization’s culture that are directly related to how you will manage projects are communication, decision-making, rituals, previous management styles, and values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importance of organizational culture \n",
    "\n",
    " * __Identity__: An organization’s culture defines its identity. Its identity essentially describes the way the company conducts  business, both internally and externally. A company’s values and organizational culture go hand-in-hand; its values are part of its identity. You can almost think of an organization’s culture as its personality. That is why it is important to learn your company’s (or target company’s) mission and value statements. The mission and value statements will help you understand why the company exists and will give you insight into what the company believes in and how it will behave.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __People__: Strong, positive organizational culture helps retain a company’s best employees. People who feel valued, engaged, and challenged are more likely to give their best and want to drive for success. An organization’s culture can help keep talented employees at a company, and it can attract great people too! On the other hand, a toxic culture can have the opposite effect. It is important to find an organization with a culture that fits your personality. One way to find out more about an organization's culture is to talk to the people who work there. You can also take note of the current employees' attire, expressions, and overall behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Processes__: Organizational culture can have direct impacts on a company's processes, and ultimately, its productivity. The organization’s culture is instilled throughout the company, from its employees to how its employees do their job. For example, a company that values feedback and employee involvement might have that reflected in their processes by including many opportunities for employees to comment. By allowing employees to feel their voices are heard, this company is adhering to its culture."

    "This structure also tells you how job tasks are divided and coordinated and how all the different members of the organization relate to one another. In other words, organizational structure gives you a sense of who reports to who.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classic Organization Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The Classic organizational structure is a top-down hierarchy system, where a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) has direct authority over several department managers. The department manager has direct authority over several other sections of employees. This system requires communication both up and down the ladder. In a Classic structure, authority comes from the top and filters to the bottom. Frequent reporting of project status updates may be required to pass up through management levels to keep higher leaders informed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Classic organizations are also referred to as functional organizations because the organization is divided into departments based on function. Each department is led by a functional manager, and employees are grouped according to the functions of their role. For example, the main function of Friendly Skies Airlines, an airline company, is to fly airplanes. There are typically departments logically arranged to fulfill other important company functions, such as Marketing, Human Resources, and Strategy. Employees usually have a specialty within the organization and may not work within other areas during normal everyday operations.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Matrix Organization Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The Matrix structure differs from the Classic structure in that the employees have two or more managers. In Matrix structures, you still have people above you, but you also have people in adjacent departments with whom you will need to communicate on your work progress. Functional areas tend to cross paths more frequently, and depending on the nature of the work, the responsible manager for each area has the most authority. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a project manager in a Matrix organization, your team will essentially have at least two chains of command, or managers. You can think of the project manager as being a temporary manager while the employee is assigned to the team, whereas the functional manager is consistent regardless of which project the employee is supporting. The visual below illustrates what the Friendly Skies Airlines would look like if it had a Matrix organizational structure.\n",

    "\n",
    "The project manager identifies the skill sets required, the timeline, and the cost to develop the training. He also identifies and documents the value that this project creates for the company.

    "## Waterfall\n",
    "\n",
    "Waterfall is a traditional methodology in which tasks and phases are completed in a linear, sequential manner, and each stage of the project must be completed before the next begins. The project manager is responsible for prioritizing and assigning tasks to team members. In Waterfall, the criteria used to measure quality is clearly defined at the beginning of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Agile\n",
    "\n",
    "Agile involves short phases of collaborative, iterative work with frequent testing and regularly-implemented improvements. Some phases and tasks happen at the same time as others. In Agile projects, teams share responsibility for managing their own work. Scrum and Kanban are examples of Agile frameworks, which are specific development approaches based on the Agile philosophy.\n",

    "## Scrum\n",
    "\n",
    "Scrum is an Agile framework that focuses on developing, delivering, and sustaining complex projects and products through collaboration, accountability, and an iterative process. Work is completed by small, cross-functional teams led by a Scrum Master and is divided into short Sprints with a set list of deliverables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kanban\n",
    "\n",
    "Kanban is both an Agile approach and a tool that provides visual feedback about the status of the work in progress through the use of Kanban boards or charts. With Kanban, project managers use sticky notes or note cards on a physical or digital Kanban board to represent the team’s tasks with categories like “To do,” “In progress,” and “Done.”\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lean\n",
    "\n",
    "Lean uses the 5S quality tool to eliminate eight areas of waste, save money, improve quality, and streamline processes. Lean’s principles state that you can do more with less by addressing dysfunctions that create waste. Lean implements a Kanban scheduling system to manage production.\n",

    "## Six Sigma\n",
    "\n",
    "Six Sigma involves reducing variations by ensuring that quality processes are followed every time. The Six Sigma method follows a process-improvement approach called DMAIC, which stands for define, measure, analyze, improve, and control.\n",

    "\n",
    "Lean Six Sigma is a combination of Lean and Six Sigma approaches. It is often used in projects that aim to save money, improve quality, and move through processes quickly. Lean Six Sigma is also ideal for solving complex or high-risk problems. The 5S quality tool, the DMAIC process, and the use of Kanban boards are all components of this approach."

    "A Project Management Office, or PMO, is a group within an organization that defines, sets, and helps maintain project management standards and processes throughout that organization. It often acts as a coordinated center for all of the organization’s projects, helping them run more smoothly and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "An organization’s project managers may operate within the PMO itself or within other departments. At Google, for example, there are project managers who work in a PMO focused on operational excellence, but there are numerous project and program managers in other departments throughout the organization, as well.\n",

    "## Key Purposes\n",
    "\n",
    "The key purposes of a PMO include: strategic planning and governance, implementing project management best practices, establishing common project culture, resource management, and creating project documentation, archives, and tools. PMOs support their organizations in managing large numbers of projects and help keep all employees working in the same direction towards the organization’s goals.\n",

    "### Best practices\n",
    "\n",
    "PMOs help implement best practices and processes within their organization. They also share lessons learned from previous successful projects. They help ensure consistency among their organization’s projects by providing guidance about processes, tools, and metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common project culture \n",
    "\n",

    "# Project Manager Key Competencies\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "These four core skill sets are essential to successful project management:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Decision-making.\n",
    " * Communicating and escalating.\n",
    " * Flexibility.\n",
    " * Strong organizational skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Enabling decision-making\n",
    "\n",
    "You can help team members feel empowered from the start of your project by making the decision-making process collaborative. For example, state the goals of specific deliverables and elicit input from your team on how to achieve those goals. You may have an idea of how you would like certain tasks to be accomplished, but your team members may have more creative or efficient approaches. Empowering your team to express their opinions and make their own decisions allows you to focus on the overarching management tasks and prioritize them in order of importance. Additionally, when you allow team members to have a voice in decisions, it helps foster an environment of responsibility, accountability, and team closeness. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Communicating and escalating\n",
    "\n",
    "Project management requires clearly communicating project goals and expectations, team member roles and responsibilities, and constructive feedback. Knowing how to effectively communicate and when to escalate issues to management is key to keeping you, your team, and your organization on the path to success. When escalation is required, try to approach management with both the problem and the potential solution or suggestions. This will show that you’re taking initiative as a project manager. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Strong organizational skills\n",
    "\n",
    "If you demonstrate that it is important for you, as a leader, to stay organized through efficient tracking and communications, your team will follow suit. One way to do this is by utilizing the abundance of organizational tools available, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Planning and scheduling software (templates, workflows, calendars)\n",
    " * Collaboration tools (email, collaboration software, dashboards)\n",
    " * Documentation (files, plans, spreadsheets)\n",
    " * Quality assurance tools (evaluations, productivity trackers, reports)\n",
    "\n",
    "You may need to experiment with different organizational approaches to determine what works best for you and your team.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Flexibility\n",
    "\n",
    "All project managers need the ability to adapt and overcome changes and challenges. Let’s further explore why flexibility is such a critical project management skill and discuss how it can help prepare your team for change, mitigate risks, and handle ambiguity. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Flexible planning\n",
    "\n",
    "Change is inevitable, and the more flexible you are as a project manager, the more successful you will be throughout your career. These flexible planning strategies can help you manage your project during times of unpredictability: \n",
    "\n",
    " * __Assess external constraints__. When planning your project, take external events into account, such as national holidays and team member vacations and sick leave. Leaving extra time in the schedule for these inevitable events up front can help minimize the impact to your project.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Plan for risks and challenges__. If you consider the risks that may occur, you may be able to find solutions for them in advance. For example, what if someone on your team gets sick or decides to quit? Are you able to replace them within the company? If not, can you hire an independent contractor? Come up with a list of people who may be able to join your team if one of your team members becomes unavailable. You can also assess risks by looking at historical data. Review your past projects and examine the challenges you faced. Then evaluate if similar challenges could occur in this project and prepare accordingly. We will discuss risk management at length later in this program.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Calculate “float” in your schedule__. Float, or slack, refers to the amount of time you can wait to begin a task before it impacts the project schedule and threatens the project outcome. Identifying float in your schedule can help with resource management, scheduling, and keeping your project on track. You will learn more about calculating float in a later course, when we discuss creating a critical path for your project tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling ambiguity\n",
    "\n",
    "Ambiguity can be a big challenge in managing projects. Project managers often face ambiguity in goals, requirements, schedules, vision, or other areas related to the project. Your team will look to you to lead during times of ambiguity and change, and flexibility is especially important during these instances. Here are some different ways to help your team deal with ambiguity: \n",
    "\n",
    " * __Keep calm__. In uncertain times, handling ambiguity with grace and poise will help inspire the members of your team to do the same. \n",
    "\n",
    " * __Express empathy__. As a project manager, it is important to try to understand what your team is thinking and feeling, especially during times of ambiguity. Let your team members know that you care about the challenges they are facing and are there to support them.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Communicate what you know clearly__. Define the aspects of the project that are confirmed and will not change. This helps your team get a better sense of what to expect, regardless of any aspects of the project that are still unknown or changing.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Make decisions and stick to them__. Try not to second-guess your decisions in front of your team since this can lead to greater uncertainty. If you need to change course, clearly explain why you have chosen to do so to your team. \n",
    "\n",
    " * __Trust the expertise of your team__. Increase clarity by having everyone on your team discuss what they already know or believe to be true about components of your project, such as what is involved in specific tasks or resources needed, based on their areas of expertise. Then, discuss what you still don’t know and brainstorm ways to gather more information."

    "# Project Scope\n",
    "---\n",

    " * What is the project expected to achieve?\n",
    " * What does the project sponsor have in mind?\n",
    " * Who approves the final results?\n",

Make sure you understand the who, what, when, where, why, and how as it applies to the scope. If you are missing any of that information, focus your questions on those elements. The initiation phase of the project sets the foundation for the project, so ensuring that you understand the scope and expectations during this stage is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope management best practices\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some best practices for scope management and controlling scope creep: \n",
    "\n",
    " * __Define your project’s requirements__: Communicate with your stakeholders or customers to find out exactly what they want from the project and document those requirements during the initiation phase. \n",
    "\n",
    " * __Set a clear project schedule__: Time and task management are essential for sticking to your project’s scope. Your schedule should outline all of your project’s requirements and the tasks that are necessary to achieve them.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Determine what is out of scope__: Make sure your stakeholders, customers, and project team understand when proposed changes are out of scope. Come to a clear agreement about the potential impacts to the project and document your agreement. \n",
    "\n",
    " * __Provide alternatives__: Suggest alternative solutions to your customer or stakeholder. You can also help them consider how their proposed changes might create additional risks. Perform a cost-benefit analysis, if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Set up a change control process__: During the course of your project, some changes are inevitable. Determine the process for how each change will be defined, reviewed, and approved (or rejected) before you add it to your project plan. Make sure your project team is aware of this process.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Learn how to say no__: Sometimes you will have to say no to proposed changes. Saying no to a key stakeholder or customer can be uncomfortable, but it can be necessary to protect your project’s scope and its overall quality. If you are asked to take on additional tasks, explain how they will interfere with the budget, timeline, and/or resources defined in your initial project requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    " * __Collect costs for out-of-scope work__: If out-of-scope work is required, be sure to document all costs incurred. That includes costs for work indirectly impacted by the increased scope. Be sure to indicate what the charges are for. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that while working in a restaurant management group, your manager calls and asks you to “update the dining space,” then quickly hangs up the phone without providing further instruction.

    "\n",
    "A RACI chart helps to define roles and responsibilities for individuals or teams to ensure work gets done efficiently. It creates clear roles and gives direction for each team member.\n",
    "\n",
    "A RACI chart can also help you analyze and balance the workload of your team. While it may take many revisions to make sure that your team members and stakeholders are being placed into the right roles in your RACI chart, doing this work up front helps save time and prevent miscommunications later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four types of participation included in a RACI chart:\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Responsible__: those doing the work to complete the task.\n",
    " * __Accountable__: those making sure the work gets done.\n",
    " * __Consulted__: those giving feedback, like subject matter expert or decision makers.\n",

    "![RACI Chart](images\\raci.png \"RACI Chart\")\n",
    "\n",
    "There will never be more than one person designated as \"accountable\". This prevents confusion, because having one person accountable clearly defines ownership. However, the same person that is \"accountable\" may also be \"responsible\".\n",
    "\n",
    "When you complete your chart, it is a good idea to go back through and tally the number of Rs assigned to each stakeholder. This can help you identify potentially overloading one team member with work. Using a RACI chart to determine responsibility for tasks can help mitigate single points of failure (known as creating silos, where the knowledge and responsibility for a task falls on one person) and allow you, as the project manager, to delegate tasks and avoid burnout.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have created your RACI chart, it is time to put it into practice. You will first need to share your RACI chart with your sponsors and stakeholders to get buy-in and sign-off. When you get stakeholder buy-in, you will be able to set clear expectations for your team and ensure that everyone is aligned on their responsibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a very small project team with a small amount of stakeholders, clearly defined roles, and a short timeline, introducing a RACI chart could possibly slow down the project. However, larger projects, or even projects that involve a large number of stakeholders, could greatly benefit from a RACI chart. It is always a good idea to work through the creation of a RACI chart and evaluate the outcome. Even if you do not end up using the RACI chart, you will have a better understanding of the project, and your effort will contribute to your project management experience overall."

    "![SMART Goals Template](images\\smart_goals.png \"SMART Goals Template\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specific\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific goals should answer at least two of the following questions:\n",

    " * What do I want to accomplish?\n",
    " * Why is this a goal?\n",
    " * Does it have a specific reason, purpose, or benefit?\n",

    " * Where should the goal be delivered?\n",
    " * To what degree? In other words, what are the requirements and constraints?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measurable\n",
    "\n",
    "Measuring is not only a way for people to track progress, but also a tool to help people stay motivated. You can tell if a goal is measurable by asking how much, how many, and how will I know when it's accomplished?\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to measure most of the goals you have with metrics. Metrics are what you use to measure something like figures or numbers. Sometimes, the success of a goal can be measured with a simple yes or no.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having measurable goals allows you to assess the success of your project based on quantifiable or tangible metrics, such as dollar amounts, number of outputs, quantities, etc. Measurable goals are important because they leave little room for confusion around expectations from stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider benchmarks, or points of reference, to make sure you're choosing accurate metrics. For instance, if your overall goal is to increase revenue, you can look at last year's data as a benchmark for deciding how much to increase revenue this year. If last year's revenue increased by 3 percent, then an increase by 5 percent in a booming economy would be a reasonable goal for this year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not every metric will have value, so you will have to determine which metrics make sense for the project. For example, measuring how many meetings the software engineers on your project attend on a weekly basis may not be the most valuable metric for a productivity goal. Alternatively, you might measure other aspects of the engineers’ productivity, such as a particular number of features created per engineer or a specific number of issues flagged per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Attainable\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal can be reasonably reached based on the metrics? Typically, you want goals that are a little challenging to encourage growth. Otherwise, what's the point of the goal if nothing's going to change? However, you don't want it to be too extreme or you'll never reach it. You'll have failed before you even started. Aim to find a balance between the two extremes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's take the goal to run a 5K. Say you regularly run 2.5 kilometers three times a week. An attainable goal would be to go from running 2.5 kilometers to running five kilometers within four weeks. An unattainable goal might be earning first-place in a 5K.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relevant\n",
    "\n",
    "Does it make sense to try and reach this goal? Think about how the goal lines up with other goals, priorities, and values. Ask whether the goal seems worthwhile. Does the effort involved balance out the benefits? Does it match your organization's other needs and priorities? Everyone from the client and the project team and the people who will ultimately use the product need to feel like the goal is worth supporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time-bound\n",
    "\n",
    "Time-bound means your goal has a deadline. Deadlines give you a way to track your progress. Otherwise, you may never reach your goal or never even get started. Time and metrics often go hand in hand, because time can also be used as a metric. Making your goal time-bound gives you a way to break down how much needs to be accomplished over time."

Some will be __active stakeholders__ with more opinions and touchpoints and others will be __passive stakeholders__, preferring only high-level updates and not involved in the day-to-day. That said, just because a stakeholder does not participate as often as others does not mean they are not important. There are lots of factors that will play a role in determining a stakeholder’s ability to participate in a project, like physical distance from the project and their existing workload. \n",
