    "\n",
    "Agile aims to solve that problem by getting customer feedback more quickly to make sure that the team is building what the customer really wants. Part of working with an Agile mindset is always seeking out ways to work more efficiently. We do this by finding ways to streamline processes without reducing product quality or value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to streamlining is to reduce waste. For example, unnecessary documentation is a form of waste. Another form of waste is spending weeks or months working on a feature, only to find out that the customers, who could also be users or stakeholders, don't like the feature after all.\n",

    "A communication plan organizes and documents the process, types, and expectations of communication for the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "A communication plan needs to address these questions:\n",
    "\n",
    " * What needs to be communicated?\n",
    " * Who needs to communicate?\n",

    "Before you begin creating the plan, answer these questions to ensure that you have all of the relevant information:\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Project stakeholders__: Have you created a RACI chart or stakeholder map of all your stakeholders? Who is your audience? Who will need to be informed at different points during the project life cycle?\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Communication frequency and method__: When and how often should you check in with your stakeholders? What methods of communication do they prefer? How much detail does each stakeholder need?\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Goals__: What is the goal of your communication? Do you need a response? Are you trying to encourage engagement or simply providing an update?\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Barriers__: Are there any time zone limitations? Language barriers? Do some stakeholders require time to reply or respond (e.g., an executive)? Are there any privacy or internet access issues?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Document and develop\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a tool or template to document all of your communication needs, and begin developing your plan. Once you understand the basic elements (stakeholders, communication methods, goals, and barriers), it’s time to work out the details! Here are some tips:\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Add a column for notes__.\n",
    "\n",
    " Project management is not one-size-fits-all, and there are a lot of pieces that need to be tracked. For instance, if you are reaching out to a senior leader or executive, do you need to copy anyone else on the email? If a stakeholder is out of office or unavailable on certain dates, do you have a backup plan? Add notes to set reminders and any additional relevant details.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Use formatting to highlight any key details in the plan__.\n",
    " \n",
    " Is there a launch announcement or an urgent decision needed for the project to move forward? Highlight these pivotal elements in a different font color or size to stress their importance.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Ensure that the team can access your document__.\n",
    "\n",
    " Share the plan with your team. Allowing your team to review the document ensures that they are aware of the plan and gives them a chance to offer feedback. Sharing the document also serves as an extra check to make sure you aren’t missing any crucial pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Test your plan__.\n",
    " \n",
    " If you are sending a team-wide email or link, send a test email to yourself or a colleague. If you are planning a virtual presentation, be sure to test the visual, audio, and other technical aspects in advance. That way, you can minimize any technical problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Check in\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your communication plan is out in the world, check in with your audience about the effectiveness of your plan. Scheduling routine check-ins will help you understand what is and is not working so you can improve your plan. You want to ensure that your communication plan gets the right information to the right stakeholders at the right time. Additionally, make sure to double check that key stakeholders have not changed over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluate where you may be over, under-sharing information or missing stakeholders. You can do this through:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Anonymous survey forms.\n",
    " * Polls or open feedback sessions during team meetings.\n",
    " * One-on-one conversations and check-ins with key stakeholders.\n",

This makes it easier to troubleshoot problems and come up with solutions. In non software environments, code would be similar to writing clear and concise processes or instructions for how to build or use your product.\n",

Testing also means checking to make sure the product features, meet the customer's requirements.\n",

You need to demonstrate to your audience that you're an expert on a given topic, whether that's through professional experience, extensive research, or something else, and you need to demonstrate relationship credibility by establishing that you're honest, trustworthy, and someone who they want to work with.\n",

    "\n",
    " Make the case for how your idea can benefit your audience. To determine this, you'll need a strong understanding of your audience and their values. In essence, what about your idea will appeal to them, and how will they stand to benefit from agreeing to your idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Provide evidence__:\n",
    "\n",
    " Make your case through hard data and persuasive storytelling. Numbers aren't strong enough on their own. They need stories to live in them up.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. __Connect emotionally__:\n",
    "\n",
    " Demonstrate to your audience that you're emotionally committed to your idea and you'll do your best to match their emotional state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Conger also identified four common mistakes that people make when attempting to influence others:\n",

    " * Approach their audience too aggressively, and that tends to put people off ideas entirely.\n",
    " * Resist compromise, which is crucial for any kind of mutual agreement.\n",

    "Project managers may be responsible for teaching and mentoring project team members, building relationships with the team and various stakeholders, controlling change and the impact to the project, empowering team members to make decisions, and communicating status and potential concerns. These interpersonal responsibilities can be just as important to the success of projects as more concrete responsibilities, like scheduling and budgeting.\n",

    "## Teaching and mentoring\n",
    "\n",
    "As a project manager, you can serve as a mentor to your team. When you take the time to fully explain the expectations, you eliminate rework, confusion, and frustration. Mentoring and teaching others the lessons that you, as a project manager, have learned allows your team to make better choices and build on your experience. Mentoring also involves supporting each individual on your team in meeting expectations and helping them to exceed their own sense of personal potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationships are everything! Getting to know your team members lets them know that you care about them as people, not just as employees. Taking the time to build relationships with your customers, clients, vendors, and other stakeholders is equally important. Dedicate time to checking in with people. Pay attention to the insights they offer you about their work style since their actions can inform how to most effectively interact with them. Ask about their lives beyond the project, and then follow up on those discussions later on to show your interest. When you foster these relationships, you are all more invested in the success of your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Controlling change\n",
    "\n",
    "The American novelist Louis L’Amour wrote, “The only thing that never changes is that everything changes.” This applies to projects as well. Projects change as you continue to understand the expectations and the needs of your stakeholders. As a project manager, you need to remain flexible and adjust to the stakeholders’ needs. However, it is also important to protect your team from constant change and rework. A good way to do this is by documenting the initial expectations of the project and clearly identifying the changes being requested. It is also helpful to understand the budget and schedule impact of the changes and make sure that the stakeholders understand those impacts. As the project manager, you are responsible for protecting your team. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Empowering your team\n",
    "\n",
    "We all enjoy being heard and appreciated in our careers. Giving your team the ability to work directly with the stakeholders and their teams lets them know that you trust and believe in their skills! One of the best things about empowering your team is getting fresh ideas and passionate employees willing to help find solutions to problems. Another way you can empower your team is by delegating responsibilities to them, allowing them to make some decisions for the project, and using their input in the planning and execution of the project. Effective mentoring often leads to more empowered teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Communicating status and concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "As a project manager, communication is everything. With effective communication, you can work together with your team to find solutions to challenges. The project manager sets the tone for the project. Maintaining an open door policy and building trust within your team and among stakeholders—all while staying positive—will help the success of the project."

    "\n",
    " * Establish a shared vision.\n",
    " * Align on scope.\n",

    "## Best practices\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Set the right time__: Choose a meeting time that works for everyone. Be mindful of time zone differences. \n",
    " * __Set the right length__: Choose an appropriate meeting length—no more than one hour. You don’t want to waste people’s time, but you also don’t want to run out of time. Kick-off meetings work best when you first share key information and then spend any additional time on questions and team building.\n",

You don’t want to leave anyone out, but you also don’t want to invite people who shouldn’t be there.\n",
    " * __Designate a notetaker__: The discussion that takes place during the meeting is important. It is critical that you document any feedback, changes, or questions asked by attendees.

    " * __Set the agenda__: A kick-off meeting agenda should generally include: introductions, the project background and purpose, project goals and scope, roles and responsibilities, the collaboration process and project tools, what comes next (expectations and action items), and time for questions and discussion.\n",
    " * __Share the agenda__: Prior to the meeting, share the agenda with attendees via email and identify speakers for each topic. By sending the agenda in advance, everyone will have an idea of what to expect, time to prepare for anything they may need to present or discuss, and time to generate questions or ideas.\n",
    " * __Stick to the agenda__: During meetings, discussions can sometimes go off topic or take longer than expected. As a project manager, it is your job to keep the meeting on track by redirecting discussions to the items on the agenda. \n",

    "# Lean And Six Sigma Methodologies\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lean\n",
    "\n",
    "Lean methodology is often referred to as Lean Manufacturing because it originated in the manufacturing world. The main principle in Lean methodology is the removal of waste within an operation. By optimizing process steps and eliminating waste, only value is added at each phase of production.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lean methodology consists of five principles that serve as a recipe for improving project outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. __Define value__: Identify and focus on what the customer wants and include the customer.\n",
    " 2. __Map value stream__: Map out the steps of production and challenge all wasted steps.\n",
    " 3. __Create flow__: Ensure the product flows through the value stream efficiently, eliminating waste throughout the cycle.\n",
    " 4. __Establish pull__: Ensure the customer is \"pulling\" on the product through this stream by asking for features and incremental deliveries.\n",
    " 5. __Pursue perfection__: Pushing your team to continuously improve the first four process steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, the Lean Manufacturing methodology recognizes eight types of waste within an operation: defects, excess processing, overproduction, waiting, inventory, transportation, motion, and non-utilized talent. In the manufacturing industry, these types of waste are often attributed to issues such as: \n",
    "\n",
    " * Lack of proper documentation\n",
    " * Lack of process standards\n",
    " * Not understanding the customers’ needs\n",
    " * Lack of effective communication\n",
    " * Lack of process control\n",
    " * Inefficient process design\n",
    " * Failures of management\n",
    "\n",
    "These same issues create waste in project management. \n",
    "\n",
    "Implement Lean project management when you want to use limited resources, reduce waste, and streamline processes to gain maximum benefits. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can achieve this by using the pillars of the Lean 5S quality tool. The term 5S refers to the five pillars that are required for good housekeeping: sort, set in order, shine, standardize, and sustain. Implementing the 5S method means cleaning up and organizing the workplace to achieve the smallest amount of wasted time and material. The 5S method includes these five steps: \n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Sort: Remove all items not needed for current production operations and leave only the bare essentials. \n",
    " 2. Set in order: Arrange needed items so that they are easy to use. Label items so that anyone can find them or put them away. \n",
    " 3. Shine: Keep everything in the correct place. Clean your workspace every day.\n",
    " 4. Standardize: Perform the process in the same way every time. \n",
    " 5. Sustain: Make a habit of maintaining correct procedures and instill this discipline in your team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the Lean methodology, 5S helps you boost performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "The final concept of Lean uses a Kanban scheduling system to manage production. The Kanban scheduling system, or Kanban board, is a visualization tool that enables you to optimize the flow of your team’s work. It gives the team a visual display to identify what needs to be done and when.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kanban board uses cards that are moved from left to right to show progress and help your team coordinate the work.\n",

    "![Kanban Board](images\\kanban.png \"Kanban Board\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## Six Sigma\n",
    "\n",
    "Six Sigma is a methodology used to reduce variations by ensuring that quality processes are followed every time. The term “Six Sigma” originates from statistics and generally means that items or processes should have $99.9996$% quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The seven key principles of Six Sigma are:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Always focus on the customer.\n",
    " 2. Identify and understand how the work gets done. Understand how work really happens.\n",
    " 3. Make your processes flow smoothly.\n",
    " 4. Reduce waste and concentrate on value.\n",
    " 5. Stop defects by removing variation.\n",
    " 6. Involve and collaborate with your team.\n",
    " 7. Approach improvement activity in a systematic way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this methodology to find aspects of the product or process that are measurable like time, cost, or quantity. Then inspect that measurable item and reject any products that do not meet the Six Sigma standard. Any process that created unacceptable products has to be improved upon.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Lean Six Sigma\n",
    "\n",
    "After both Lean and Six Sigma were put into practice, it was discovered that the two methodologies could be combined to increase benefits. The tools used in Lean, such as Kanban boards and 5S, build quality in processes from the beginning. Products developed using Lean methods are then inspected or tested using Six Sigma standards. The products that do not meet these standards are rejected. \n",
    "\n",
    "The largest difference between these methodologies is that Lean streamlines processes while Six Sigma reduces variation in products by building in quality from the beginning and inspecting products to ensure quality standards are met. You may find that one of these two methods—or using them both together—can improve the efficiency of your projects."

With big projects that go on for months, you'll want to keep the teams motivation high. A milestone signifies the completion of an important chunk of work and provides a moment of celebration for the team, even if there's more work ahead. Achieving milestones serve as a great check-in point to highlight your progress to stakeholders.

    " * __Don’t mistake tasks for milestones__: Remember that milestones should represent moments in time, and in order to map out how you will get to those moments, you need to assign smaller tasks to each milestone.\n",
    " * __Don’t list your milestones and tasks separately__: Make sure that tasks and milestones can be visualized together in one place, such as a project plan. This will help ensure that you are hitting your deadlines and milestones. "

    " * Is it ambitious yet realistic?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some best practices to keep in mind when writing OKRs:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Think of your objectives as being motivational and inspiring and your key results as being tactical and specific. The objective describes what you want to do and the key results describe how you’ll know you did it. \n",
    " * As a general rule, try to develop around 2-3 key results for each objective.\n",
    " * Be sure to document your OKRs and link to them in your project plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "## OKRs vs SMART goals\n",
    "\n",
    "In OKRs, the \"objectives\" provide general, inspirational aims, while the \"key results\" detail the time-based metrics by which you gauge success. OKRs are typically both less specific and more aspirational than SMART goals, and as such, they often encourage the journey toward cultural change or a breakthrough development.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, SMART goals tend to measure a single metric, such as profitability or quality. These goals focus and track discrete individual efforts, but can still move a business or an individual forward. Sometimes, management will write and cascade SMART goals throughout the organization to ensure the quality and consistency of results. \n",
    "\n",
    "SMART goals are also frequently tied to compensation, whereas compensation is gauged separately from OKR achievement to encourage experimentation or a useful fail (wherein a team may grow capabilities but not fully achieve an aspirational goal).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Communicating and tracking OKRs\n",
    "\n",
    "Conducting regular check-ins and actively tracking progress with your team can help ensure that objectives are being met and that any issues are resolved as soon as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Share your OKRs with your team. Once you’ve created OKRs for your project, it’s important to communicate them to your team so that everyone knows how to focus and align their efforts. You can do this by sharing a digital document, presenting them in a meeting, or adding them to an internal website. OKRs can help your project team stick to its goals, monitor which are falling short, and be continuously motivated to meet project objectives. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assign owners. Assign an owner to every key result so that everybody knows who’s responsible for what. This helps add clarity and increases accountability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measuring progress\n",
    "\n",
    "Measuring your OKRs is an important part of tracking and sharing your progress. One shortcut to determining the status of a project is to score or grade your OKRs. While scores or grades don’t provide a complete assessment of a project’s success, they’re helpful tools for determining how close you came to achieving your objectives. You can then share your OKR scores with project stakeholders and team members as part of your overall project updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are recommended guidelines you can follow:\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Determine how you will score your OKRs__: OKRs can be scored in different ways. You can score based on a percentage of the objective completed, the completion of certain milestones, or a scale of 1 to 10, for example. You can also use a \"traffic light\" scoring approach, where red means you didn’t make any progress, yellow means you made some progress, and green means you completed your objective.\n",
    "\n",
    " The simplest approach to scoring OKRs is the \"yes/no\" method, with \"yes\" meaning you achieved your objective and \"no\" meaning you didn’t. Using this approach, a key result such as \"Launch a new widget marketing campaign\" might be graded a 1 or 0 depending on whether it was launched (1) or not (0). \n",
    "\n",
    " A more advanced scoring approach is to grade your key results on a scale. With this method, if a key result was to \"Launch six new features\" and only three new features were launched, the OKR might be graded 0.5. Generally, if the KR helped you achieve the objective, your OKR should receive a higher score; if it didn't, your OKR should receive a lower score. \n",
    "\n",
    " At Google, OKRs are usually graded on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0, with 1.0 meaning the objective was fully achieved. Each individual key result is graded and then the grades are averaged to determine the score for that OKR.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Set your scoring expectations__: With Google’s 0.0–1.0 scale, the expectation is to set ambitious OKRs and aim to achieve an average of at least 0.6 to 0.7 across all OKRs. For OKRs graded according to percentage achieved, the sweet spot is somewhere in the 60–70% range. Scoring lower may mean the team is not achieving what it could be. Scoring higher may mean the aspirational goals are not being set high enough. \n",
    "\n",
    " * __Schedule checkpoints__: It’s important to regularly communicate the status of project OKRs with your team and senior managers. For example, it can be helpful to have monthly check-ins on the progress of OKRs to give both individuals and your team a sense of where they are. Typically, at the end of the quarter, you’ll grade each of your OKRs to evaluate how well the team did to achieve its goals."

It can be though of as the organization's personality.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a project manager, it is important to understand your company’s culture, especially because it could affect the projects you work on. Some aspects of an organization’s culture that are directly related to how you will manage projects are communication, decision-making, rituals, previous management styles, and values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importance of organizational culture \n",
    "\n",
    " * __Identity__: An organization’s culture defines its identity. Its identity essentially describes the way the company conducts  business, both internally and externally. A company’s values and organizational culture go hand-in-hand; its values are part of its identity. You can almost think of an organization’s culture as its personality. That is why it is important to learn your company’s (or target company’s) mission and value statements. The mission and value statements will help you understand why the company exists and will give you insight into what the company believes in and how it will behave.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __People__: Strong, positive organizational culture helps retain a company’s best employees. People who feel valued, engaged, and challenged are more likely to give their best and want to drive for success. An organization’s culture can help keep talented employees at a company, and it can attract great people too! On the other hand, a toxic culture can have the opposite effect. It is important to find an organization with a culture that fits your personality. One way to find out more about an organization's culture is to talk to the people who work there. You can also take note of the current employees' attire, expressions, and overall behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Processes__: Organizational culture can have direct impacts on a company's processes, and ultimately, its productivity. The organization’s culture is instilled throughout the company, from its employees to how its employees do their job. For example, a company that values feedback and employee involvement might have that reflected in their processes by including many opportunities for employees to comment. By allowing employees to feel their voices are heard, this company is adhering to its culture."

There are typically departments logically arranged to fulfill other important company functions, such as Marketing, Human Resources, and Strategy.

Low means if the risk occurs, it will have a slight impact but it's not likely to derail the project.\n",

    "There are typically five steps that make up the procurement process:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. __Initiating__: the planning process of defining what help you may need outside of your current resources to hit the project goals.\n",
    "\n",
    " While planning your project, figure out which materials, resources, and supplies you will need to get the job done. During this step, you will decide which items will be internally procured and which items will be externally outsourced. Once you’ve decided which items you need to outsource, compare each of those items specifications, components, quality measurements, standards, and characteristics with your project’s requirements. You may find that some of the items have features you don’t need. If you can identify those unnecessary features, you will know exactly what you want and don’t want in an item, possibly reducing your total cost.\n",
    " \n",
    " 2. __Selecting__: deciding what supplies you need and which vendors you'll go through.\n",
    "\n",
    " Now that you have outlined what you need for your project, you need to determine vendors to source these items. Research and assess various vendors and suppliers, and try to find out if your preferred vendors have a reputation for delivering quality work on time. After you’ve identified your preferred vendors and suppliers, interview them to learn more about their products and services. If possible, make site visits to see exactly how each vendor runs their business in person. \n",
    " \n",
    " 3. __Contract writing__: where the contracts are developed, reviewed, and signed.\n",
    "\n",
    " Contract writing requires excellent attention to detail, so pay close attention to the inclusions and exclusions in the vendor’s offer. There may be some items included in the vendor’s price that you can provide in-house at low or no additional cost. For example, the vendor’s offer may include charges for storing materials, using certain equipment, or labor. These are all things that you may be able to provide from your organization’s resources, so you can opt to save costs with the vendor on those items by using in-house materials and resources. \n",
    "\n",
    " Sometimes, the vendor may write the contract. In this case, checking carefully for clarity and accuracy ensures that you know exactly what you are getting from the vendor. Whether the contract is written by you or by the vendor, you will almost always want to consult with a legal and compliance team to ensure that everything in the contract is ethical and legal.\n",
    "\n",
    " 4. __Control__: make payments, set up logistics and requirements to maintain quality, and ensure the service agreement is being met.\n",
    "\n",
    " The procurement process isn’t over when the contracts are signed. The next step is to ensure that the work is being done according to the terms of the contract. You will need to periodically review the performance and quality of each vendor. When communicating with vendors, remain professional but firm to ensure that all project requirements are being fulfilled and that all major milestones are being met on time and at cost. \n",
    "\n",
    " Building and maintaining a good relationship with your vendors benefits the team and the overall project. This relationship will make it easier to make adjustments and contract revisions if the need arises. Taking certain measures, like conducting regular check-in meetings, will ensure that the work is being completed according to plan. \n",
    "\n",
    " 5. __Completing__: measure the success of the procurement.\n",
    "\n",
    " In the completing step of the procurement process, you will measure the success of your procurements. Ask yourself:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Were the materials created good quality?\n",
    "    * Were there any issues with labor contracts?\n",
    "    * How were your relationships with vendors?\n",
    " \n",
    " During this step, it is also important to document any lessons learned. It is likely that you will be involved in another project similar to this one in the future. Take notes about how the procurement process went so you can use this information on a future project.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few important documents that help a project manager navigate through each phase of procurement. For instance, in the initiating phase, a project manager will create a non-disclosure agreement, otherwise known as an NDA. In the selecting phase, a project manager creates a request for proposal, or an RFP. In the contracting phase, a statement of work or an SOW is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "The procurement process can seem a little different depending on the project management methodology. There are differences in procurement in the context of Agile versus traditional.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Agile procurement management\n",
    "\n",
    "Agile procurement management is often more collaborative, with both the project team and the end supplier than traditional approaches. There is a heavy emphasis on the relationship between these parties. The whole project team plays a larger role in identifying what needs to be procured. Rather than featuring contracts that are based on fixed deliverables, Agile procurement management tends to have a living contract that can be adapted based on the evaluation of the project.\n",
    " \n",
    "If you think of the word \"agility\", which means to move easily and quickly, you'll be able to remember that Agile procurement can change more easily than traditional procurement methods. In this process, the team reviews the project or deliverables on a reccurring basis and consistently addresses feedback. This way of working is important to communicate to your suppliers so they understand this style of working and agree to maintain flexibility.\n",
    " \n",
    "Again, it is so important to have a positive relationship with the procurement supplier. This is critical since the contract may need to be renegotiated at multiple points during the project.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Traditional procurement management\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional procurement management tends to focus on standard contracts with clear terms and deliverables. When it comes to traditional approaches, the project manager may be responsible for end-to-end procurement instead of the entire team providing input.\n",
    " \n",
    "The contracts may feature lengthy and extensive documentation that includes fixed requirements and comprehensive detail of the services and deliverables. While this may appear more rigid, the benefit is you've outlined clearer workstreams and deadlines. This way, you're much more protected from unforeseen circumstances and may not have to pay for unpredictable changes.\n",
    " \n",
    "In traditional approaches, the negotiation process can be a little bit trickier. You won't necessarily have the room to renegotiate contracts if something changes, so you may have to start the whole process over again. That's why being as detailed as possible and spending more time in the negotiation phase is incredibly important in a more traditional project management approach."

    "# Project Budget\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "A project budget is the estimated monetary resources needed to achieve the project's goals and objectives. When reviewing a project budget, you need to consider all of the potential and projected costs needed to complete the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "You break the budget down by milestones, which are important points within the project schedule that indicate progress and usually signifies the completion of a deliverable or phase of the project, and list activities and tasks alongside their associated costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common aspects of a project budget will include:\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Team__: the cost of the people performing the work.\n",
    " * __Services__: any outside vendors helping your project.\n",
    " * __Materials__: any tangible items purchased to complete the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that you calculate the correct expenses for a particular period of time. This is considered a forecast. A forecast for your project budget is a cost estimate or a prediction over a period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Budget creation takes place in the initiation phase of the project, though the project manager may need to adjust the budget throughout the project life cycle. The budgeting process usually happens in conjunction with the scheduling process because the steps of the scheduling process are highly dependent on the costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several factors to consider when creating a budget, including resource cost rates, reserve analysis, contingency budget, and cost of quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a budget, a project manager must account for:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Understanding stakeholder needs.\n",
    " * Budgeting for surplus expenses.\n",
    " * Maintaining adaptability.\n",
    " * Reviewing and reforecasting throughout the entire project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going too far over or under budget will change the way the company budgets for the next year, potentially leaving the project manager with less money to work with in the future. In other words, a project manager must show the requested amount of money was used in order to secure enough budget for future projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Project Budget Template](images\\budget_template.png \"Project Budget Template\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## Baseline budget\n",
    "\n",
    "A baseline budget is an estimate of project costs that you start with at the beginning of your project. Once you have created a budget for your project and gotten it approved, you should publish this baseline and use it to compare against actual performance progress. This will give you insight into how your project budget is doing and allow you to make informed adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of costs\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of costs that your project will incur. For example, you may need to account for both direct costs and indirect costs in your project budget. Categorize these different types of costs in your budget so that you can ensure you are meeting the requirements of your organization and customer. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Direct costs\n",
    "\n",
    "These are costs for items that are necessary in order to complete your project. These costs can include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Wages and salaries of employees and contractors \n",
    "* Materials costs\n",
    "* Equipment rental costs\n",
    "* Software licenses \n",
    "* Project-related travel and transportation costs\n",
    "* Staff training\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indirect costs\n",
    "\n",
    "These are costs for items which do not directly lead to the completion of your project but are still essential for the project team to do their work. They are also referred to as __overhead costs__.\n",
    "\n",
    "These costs can include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Administrative costs\n",
    "* Utilities\n",
    "* Insurance \n",
    "* General office equipment \n",
    "* Security\n",
    "\n",
    "## Estimation Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various resources and tactics that you can use to make sure you aren't overestimating or underestimating your project budget:\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Researching historical data__: Review past projects that are similar to yours to get an idea of what your project could entail. This way, you can find out what past project managers did right and wrong. The more experienced you become as a project manager, the more historical data you will have to draw upon, and the better your estimations will be.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Leveraging experts__: To leverage something means to use it to its maximum advantage. Leveraging experts means gathering their insights to do something more effectively. Reaching out to colleagues who worked on a similar project in the past will be a great resource for you as an entry-level project manager. If you're asking someone outside of your company for advice, be sure to avoid sharing any confidential company information with them.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Bottom-up approach__: When making a project budget, the bottom-up approach is thinking about all the parts of a project from the beginning to the end, including making a list of every material, resource, contract worker, or anything that comes with an associated cost, and adding all of that together. You should also ask the vendors you are thinking of working with for quotes, so you can get a rough estimate of how much their work will cost. After you've created your budget with these resources, you'll want to double-check everything to confirm accuracy.\n",
    " \n",
    " * __Setting your baseline__: Your baseline is the dollar amount that you'll use to measure against, to find out if you're on track or not, and to measure the success of your project. Once you've set your baseline, you'll have to revisit that number and adjust it to match where the project is currently. Making adjustments in real-time is something you have to do a lot as a project manager. The size of the project and company will determine how often you should re-examine and update the budget. Creating a thorough budget is important to the success of your project.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Confirming accuracy__: After you've created your budget with these resources, you'll want to double-check everything to confirm accuracy. Monitoring the budget is crucial for a project manager to enforce accountability in terms of spending. Milestones are a great opportunity to re-review the budget to identify if anything needs to be reset or revisited throughout the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best practices\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few tips to consider when creating your project budget:\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Reference historical data__: Your project may be similar to a previous project your organization has worked on. It is important to review how that project’s budget was handled, find out what went well, and learn from any previous mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Utilize your team, mentors, or manager__: Get into the habit of asking for your team to double check your work to give you additional sets of eyes on your documents.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Time-phase your budget__: Time-phased budgeting allows you to allocate costs for project tasks over the projected timeline in which those expenses are planned to take place. By looking at your tasks against a timeline, you can track and compare planned versus actual costs over time and manage changes to your budget as necessary.\n",
    " \n",
    " * __Check, check, and double check__: Make sure that your budget is accurate and error-free. Your budget will likely require approval from another department, such as finance or senior management, so do your best to ensure that it is as straightforward to understand as possible and that all of your calculations are correct."

    "\n",
    "A project charter is a formal document that clearly defines the project and outlines the necessary details to outline its goals. It is a document that contains all the details of a project. For example, every project must have a justification, a start and an end date, a budget, etc. The project charter makes clear that the benefits of the project outweigh the costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A project charter allows you to get organized, set up a framework for what needs to be done, and communicate those details to others. Once you've drafted the charter, you would then review the document with key stakeholders to get their approval to move into the planning stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Project Charter Template](images\\project_charter.png \"Project Charter Template\")\n",
    "\n",
    "A project charter has the following elements:\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Core Team Members__: This lists key team members, including the project manager with their roles and responsibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Summary Project Status__: This gives an overview of the project information such as project start date, estimated completion date, potential financial impact (benefit).\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Milestones__: The project milestone is a significant point or event in the project. This could be a kick-off meeting, mobilization to site, final report submission, completion of a deliverable, etc. The milestones are listed along with an approximate due date.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Opportunity__: This is the problem-solution statement. What is this project intending to fulfill? What advantages is this project bringing to users or the performing organization?\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Goal__: These are measurable targets that the project aims to achieve. Goals must be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-bound).\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Objective__: While goals are vision, objectives are mission. They are concrete deliverables that make the goal come alive.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Scope__: This is the high-level scope of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Business Case__: This gives a justification for the project’s existence. It is usually developed after a feasibility study, or cost-benefit analysis has been carried out.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Constraints__: These are limitations imposed on the project objective, such as time and budget, scope, quality. As the project evolves, the constraints may vary, especially for highly uncertain projects using the Agile approach.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Assumptions__: They are conditions taken as true or valid without proof. They are recorded in the assumption log. For example, you could assume that the male/female ratio will be 80 to 20. However, as the project commences, Government regulations may demand gender equality of 50:50. Hence, the assumption will be updated.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Deliverables__: These are the specific outcomes the project is expected to achieve. They are the project take-home. A deliverable may be \"register 1000 subscribers within 48 hours\". Deliverables are the benchmark of performance measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Stakeholders__: This shows the entities that can impact or be impacted by the project. Critical project team members are mentioned. It may include investors, or any government department, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Sponsor Approval and Date__: The last item common in a project charter is the sponsor’s name, signature, and date signifying the authorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other elements of the project charter are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Project title and description, pre-assigned resources (individuals or resources that are set out for the project before later enlisting of project members/resources; you secure these resources upfront through top management), high-level project and product requirements, acceptance criteria, high-level risks, and expected benefits of the project."

    "# Project Closing\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Project closing consists of the process performed to formally complete the project, the current phase, and contractual obligations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Completing a project is not the same thing as closing a project. Just because a project is done doesn't mean it's closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three criteria that make up a project closing:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. __Assure all work is done__:\n",
    " \n",
    " Ensure that the agreed upon project management processes are executed and get formal recognition from stakeholders that the project is done.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. __All agreed upon project management processes are executed__:\n",
    "\n",
    " Sometimes, managerial tasks get overlooked. If the task itself is finished, the procedural or administrative work that needs to take place afterwards might slip your mind.\n",
    " \n",
    " An example might be getting contracts signed and processed. It might have been months since the project was completed, but when you revisit the contract with your plant provider, you realize that neither of you ended up actually signing it. This is a crucial misstep that leaves both parties vulnerable, and it's now taking place way after the new services official launch.\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. __Formal recognition and agreement that the project is done by key stakeholders__:\n",
    "\n",
    " If you don't have formal approval from all stakeholders that a project is over, certain stakeholders may still request adjustments to the project because they'll think it's still active. This may affect various members of your team.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid negative impacts to your team, there are a couple of different types of projects that you'll want to know about and avoid. These are: the never-ending project and the abandoned project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The never-ending project exists when, for whatever reason, the project deliverables and tasks cannot be completed. . The abandoned project exists when inadequate handoff of the project deliverables occurs. Basically, the final deliverable never makes it to your customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best practices for closing a project\n",
    "\n",
    " * Decide if your project warrants a small closing process at the end of each milestone or a formal and more comprehensive closing phase near the very end. You may even decide to do both the small closing process at the end of each milestone and a more formal closing phase at the very end.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Conduct administrative closure of the procurement process. Close any contracts necessary, deliver the payments to vendors, and retrieve all final deliverables from contracted workers. This is really important so that external stakeholders and contracted workers can understand that the phase or the project is officially over.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Formally recognize the completion of the phase, if necessary. Make sure all stakeholders are aware that a phase or project is ending. This may be as simple as sending out an email notifying them that you've achieved this milestone or may warrent a larger meeting.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Provide the necessary training, tools, documentation, and capability to use your product.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Ensure that the project has satisfied its goals and desired outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Document acceptance from all stakeholders. Ensuring that you have written proof that stakeholders are happy with the deliverables and outcomes is very important.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Review all contracts and documentation. This includes the SOW, RFP, RACI chart, risk register, and the procurement documents.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Conduct a formal retrospective. Include your team, any other teams involved, your stakeholders, and outside vendors in this meeting.\n",
    " \n",
    " * Complete any necessary follow-up work. This includes things like gathering final feedback and conducting closing surveys.\n",

It is also his role to ensure that all stakeholders are in agreement on the goals and overall mission of the project before moving on to the next phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project manager identifies the skill sets required, the timeline, and the cost to develop the training. He also identifies and documents the value that this project creates for the company.

His role as the project manager is not to complete the individual tasks but to help break down any barriers that would slow or stop the team from completing their tasks. It is also his responsibility to communicate schedule and quality expectations. He uses his communication skills to keep the customer up to date on the project status and gather feedback from them. This keeps the project on schedule and within budget.\n",

Are we behind schedule? Ahead of schedule? Or on pace with our projections? Similarly, it's common to discuss the budget status and any new items that impact your bottom line. Then you should discuss current or anticipated issues.\n",
    " \n",
    " For example, changes, risks, resource issues, vendor issues, and so on. Particularly changes to quality and scope. It's always a good idea to raise these items on a recurring basis so that no one is caught off guard and you can discuss solutions together. Lastly, you'll want to discuss action items. An action item is a task on your list that needs to be completed. Assigning action items is a great way to wrap up the meeting and make sure the project keeps forging ahead. Remember, every action item has an owner and a due date.\n",
    " \n",
    " The status meeting is a fundamental project tool that keeps the project on track. Most project managers recommend using a relatively fixed agenda and time with this meeting. To keep the team engaged, follow the agenda, and hold the meeting to a tight schedule. Because the project manager should be able to report up-to-date information to the project sponsors or clients at any time, it's important to conduct status meetings regularly.\n",
    " \n",
    " Status meetings are beneficial because they provide an opportunity for recognizing milestones, sharing information, and raising concerns to the team. How often you decide to schedule these meetings depends on several factors, such as the project's complexity, number of team members, and the level of information required by the project sponsor, clients, or others. Don't be afraid to change up the cadence as your project progresses.\n",

Then respond accordingly and make necessary adjustments to resolve those challenges. Winning and sustaining the support of your stakeholders is important to your project's success.\n",
    " \n",
    " In some cases, you might want to have stakeholder meetings on a one-on-one basis. This allows you to dive deeper on relevant details with each stakeholder. Then you can cover the topics that are most interesting and concerning to that particular person. Other times you'll need to engage stakeholders in groups.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "A project management methodology is a set of guiding principles and processes for owning a project through its lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of process management methodologies:\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Linear__: the previous phase or task has to be completed before the next can start.\n",
    " * __Iterative__: some of the phases and tasks will overlap or happen at the same time that other tasks are being worked on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Project management methodologies help guide project managers throughout a project with steps to take, tasks to complete, and principles for managing the project overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a brief summary of the most common project management approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Waterfall\n",
    "\n",
    "Waterfall is a traditional methodology in which tasks and phases are completed in a linear, sequential manner, and each stage of the project must be completed before the next begins. The project manager is responsible for prioritizing and assigning tasks to team members. In Waterfall, the criteria used to measure quality is clearly defined at the beginning of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Agile\n",
    "\n",
    "Agile involves short phases of collaborative, iterative work with frequent testing and regularly-implemented improvements. Some phases and tasks happen at the same time as others. In Agile projects, teams share responsibility for managing their own work. Scrum and Kanban are examples of Agile frameworks, which are specific development approaches based on the Agile philosophy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scrum\n",
    "\n",
    "Scrum is an Agile framework that focuses on developing, delivering, and sustaining complex projects and products through collaboration, accountability, and an iterative process. Work is completed by small, cross-functional teams led by a Scrum Master and is divided into short Sprints with a set list of deliverables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kanban\n",
    "\n",
    "Kanban is both an Agile approach and a tool that provides visual feedback about the status of the work in progress through the use of Kanban boards or charts. With Kanban, project managers use sticky notes or note cards on a physical or digital Kanban board to represent the team’s tasks with categories like “To do,” “In progress,” and “Done.”\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lean\n",
    "\n",
    "Lean uses the 5S quality tool to eliminate eight areas of waste, save money, improve quality, and streamline processes. Lean’s principles state that you can do more with less by addressing dysfunctions that create waste. Lean implements a Kanban scheduling system to manage production.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Six Sigma\n",
    "\n",
    "Six Sigma involves reducing variations by ensuring that quality processes are followed every time. The Six Sigma method follows a process-improvement approach called DMAIC, which stands for define, measure, analyze, improve, and control.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lean Six Sigma\n",
    "\n",
    "Lean Six Sigma is a combination of Lean and Six Sigma approaches. It is often used in projects that aim to save money, improve quality, and move through processes quickly. Lean Six Sigma is also ideal for solving complex or high-risk problems. The 5S quality tool, the DMAIC process, and the use of Kanban boards are all components of this approach."

    "# Project Manager Key Competencies\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "These four core skill sets are essential to successful project management:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Decision-making.\n",
    " * Communicating and escalating.\n",
    " * Flexibility.\n",
    " * Strong organizational skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Enabling decision-making\n",
    "\n",
    "You can help team members feel empowered from the start of your project by making the decision-making process collaborative. For example, state the goals of specific deliverables and elicit input from your team on how to achieve those goals. You may have an idea of how you would like certain tasks to be accomplished, but your team members may have more creative or efficient approaches. Empowering your team to express their opinions and make their own decisions allows you to focus on the overarching management tasks and prioritize them in order of importance. Additionally, when you allow team members to have a voice in decisions, it helps foster an environment of responsibility, accountability, and team closeness. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Communicating and escalating\n",
    "\n",
    "Project management requires clearly communicating project goals and expectations, team member roles and responsibilities, and constructive feedback. Knowing how to effectively communicate and when to escalate issues to management is key to keeping you, your team, and your organization on the path to success. When escalation is required, try to approach management with both the problem and the potential solution or suggestions. This will show that you’re taking initiative as a project manager. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Strong organizational skills\n",
    "\n",
    "If you demonstrate that it is important for you, as a leader, to stay organized through efficient tracking and communications, your team will follow suit. One way to do this is by utilizing the abundance of organizational tools available, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Planning and scheduling software (templates, workflows, calendars)\n",
    " * Collaboration tools (email, collaboration software, dashboards)\n",
    " * Documentation (files, plans, spreadsheets)\n",
    " * Quality assurance tools (evaluations, productivity trackers, reports)\n",
    "\n",
    "You may need to experiment with different organizational approaches to determine what works best for you and your team.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Flexibility\n",
    "\n",
    "All project managers need the ability to adapt and overcome changes and challenges. Let’s further explore why flexibility is such a critical project management skill and discuss how it can help prepare your team for change, mitigate risks, and handle ambiguity. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Flexible planning\n",
    "\n",
    "Change is inevitable, and the more flexible you are as a project manager, the more successful you will be throughout your career. These flexible planning strategies can help you manage your project during times of unpredictability: \n",
    "\n",
    " * __Assess external constraints__. When planning your project, take external events into account, such as national holidays and team member vacations and sick leave. Leaving extra time in the schedule for these inevitable events up front can help minimize the impact to your project.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Plan for risks and challenges__. If you consider the risks that may occur, you may be able to find solutions for them in advance. For example, what if someone on your team gets sick or decides to quit? Are you able to replace them within the company? If not, can you hire an independent contractor? Come up with a list of people who may be able to join your team if one of your team members becomes unavailable. You can also assess risks by looking at historical data. Review your past projects and examine the challenges you faced. Then evaluate if similar challenges could occur in this project and prepare accordingly. We will discuss risk management at length later in this program.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Calculate “float” in your schedule__. Float, or slack, refers to the amount of time you can wait to begin a task before it impacts the project schedule and threatens the project outcome. Identifying float in your schedule can help with resource management, scheduling, and keeping your project on track. You will learn more about calculating float in a later course, when we discuss creating a critical path for your project tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling ambiguity\n",
    "\n",
    "Ambiguity can be a big challenge in managing projects. Project managers often face ambiguity in goals, requirements, schedules, vision, or other areas related to the project. Your team will look to you to lead during times of ambiguity and change, and flexibility is especially important during these instances. Here are some different ways to help your team deal with ambiguity: \n",
    "\n",
    " * __Keep calm__. In uncertain times, handling ambiguity with grace and poise will help inspire the members of your team to do the same. \n",
    "\n",
    " * __Express empathy__. As a project manager, it is important to try to understand what your team is thinking and feeling, especially during times of ambiguity. Let your team members know that you care about the challenges they are facing and are there to support them.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Communicate what you know clearly__. Define the aspects of the project that are confirmed and will not change. This helps your team get a better sense of what to expect, regardless of any aspects of the project that are still unknown or changing.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Make decisions and stick to them__. Try not to second-guess your decisions in front of your team since this can lead to greater uncertainty. If you need to change course, clearly explain why you have chosen to do so to your team. \n",
    "\n",
    " * __Trust the expertise of your team__. Increase clarity by having everyone on your team discuss what they already know or believe to be true about components of your project, such as what is involved in specific tasks or resources needed, based on their areas of expertise. Then, discuss what you still don’t know and brainstorm ways to gather more information."

    "## Scope management best practices\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    " * __Define your project’s requirements__: Communicate with your stakeholders or customers to find out exactly what they want from the project and document those requirements during the initiation phase. \n",
    "\n",
    " * __Set a clear project schedule__: Time and task management are essential for sticking to your project’s scope. Your schedule should outline all of your project’s requirements and the tasks that are necessary to achieve them.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Determine what is out of scope__: Make sure your stakeholders, customers, and project team understand when proposed changes are out of scope. Come to a clear agreement about the potential impacts to the project and document your agreement. \n",
    "\n",
    " * __Provide alternatives__: Suggest alternative solutions to your customer or stakeholder. You can also help them consider how their proposed changes might create additional risks. Perform a cost-benefit analysis, if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Set up a change control process__: During the course of your project, some changes are inevitable. Determine the process for how each change will be defined, reviewed, and approved (or rejected) before you add it to your project plan. Make sure your project team is aware of this process.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Learn how to say no__: Sometimes you will have to say no to proposed changes. Saying no to a key stakeholder or customer can be uncomfortable, but it can be necessary to protect your project’s scope and its overall quality. If you are asked to take on additional tasks, explain how they will interfere with the budget, timeline, and/or resources defined in your initial project requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    " * __Collect costs for out-of-scope work__: If out-of-scope work is required, be sure to document all costs incurred. That includes costs for work indirectly impacted by the increased scope. Be sure to indicate what the charges are for. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",

    " * __Status__: Status is a crucial piece. The status of the project illustrates your actual progress versus your planned progress.\n",

Amber/Yellow means that there are potential issues with schedule or budget, but that the issues can likely be resolved with corrective actions. And green means the schedule and budget are doing fine and that the project is on track. You can use RAG to indicate the overall project status, as well as milestone status.\n",

But, in the project status report, it is common to summarize these items into two categories to better communicate the status. You will use key accomplishments to detail what has happened, and upcoming to detail what big milestones you will accomplish next.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Issues__: The issues include your project's current roadblocks and potential risks. Status reports are an important opportunity to set expectations with your stakeholders. If your project status is red or amber, you can flag what is preventing you from being where you planned to be. You can also use this opportunity to state your plan to get the project back to green, and ask for any resources or help you may need to do so."

These standards must be met in order for the product, process, or service to be considered successful by the organization and the customer.\n",
    " \n",

    "When you complete your chart, it is a good idea to go back through and tally the number of Rs assigned to each stakeholder. This can help you identify potentially overloading one team member with work. Using a RACI chart to determine responsibility for tasks can help mitigate single points of failure (known as creating silos, where the knowledge and responsibility for a task falls on one person) and allow you, as the project manager, to delegate tasks and avoid burnout.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have created your RACI chart, it is time to put it into practice. You will first need to share your RACI chart with your sponsors and stakeholders to get buy-in and sign-off. When you get stakeholder buy-in, you will be able to set clear expectations for your team and ensure that everyone is aligned on their responsibilities.\n",

However, larger projects, or even projects that involve a large number of stakeholders, could greatly benefit from a RACI chart. It is always a good idea to work through the creation of a RACI chart and evaluate the outcome. Even if you do not end up using the RACI chart, you will have a better understanding of the project, and your effort will contribute to your project management experience overall."

    "![Risk Mitigation](images\\risk_mitigation.png \"Risk Mitigation\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## Avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy seeks to sidestep, or avoid, the situation as a whole. For example, you can consider using an alternative supplier that can be widely available to mitigate the risk of a supplier not being able to deliver at a particular location.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Minimize, Reduce or Control\n",
    "\n",
    "Mitigating a risk involves trying to minimize the catastrophic effects that it could have on the project. The key to minimizing risk starts with realizing that the risk exists. That is why you will usually hear mitigation strategies referred to as workarounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to mitigate the risk of changes in regulation and taxes, you can consider to use suppliers from two different locations. The change in taxation and regulation wouldn’t affect both companies, and this would provide some flexibility without having to completely eliminate a preferred supplier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy of transferring shifts the responsibility of handling the risk to someone else.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the team could find a supplier in North America that acquires the required materials from several other South American countries and purchase those materials from them instead. This transfers the ownership of South American regulatory risks and costs to that supplier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accept\n",
    "\n",
    "When you accept the risk as the normal cost of doing business. Active acceptance of risk usually means setting aside extra funds to pay your way out of trouble. Passive acceptance of risk is the \"do nothing\" approach. While passive acceptance may be reasonable for smaller risks, it is not recommended for most single point of failure risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to be proactive and mitigate risks ahead of time whenever possible, as this may save you from having to accept risks. For example, you could schedule a meeting with project stakeholders to discuss the increase in South American taxes and how it could impact the project cost. Then, they might decide to actively accept the risk by setting aside additional funds to source the required materials from another supplier, if necessary, or to passively accept the risk of not receiving those materials."

    " * Why is this a goal?\n",
    " * Does it have a specific reason, purpose, or benefit?\n",

    " * Where should the goal be delivered?\n",
    " * To what degree? In other words, what are the requirements and constraints?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measurable\n",
    "\n",
    "Measuring is not only a way for people to track progress, but also a tool to help people stay motivated. You can tell if a goal is measurable by asking how much, how many, and how will I know when it's accomplished?\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to measure most of the goals you have with metrics. Metrics are what you use to measure something like figures or numbers. Sometimes, the success of a goal can be measured with a simple yes or no.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having measurable goals allows you to assess the success of your project based on quantifiable or tangible metrics, such as dollar amounts, number of outputs, quantities, etc. Measurable goals are important because they leave little room for confusion around expectations from stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider benchmarks, or points of reference, to make sure you're choosing accurate metrics. For instance, if your overall goal is to increase revenue, you can look at last year's data as a benchmark for deciding how much to increase revenue this year. If last year's revenue increased by 3 percent, then an increase by 5 percent in a booming economy would be a reasonable goal for this year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not every metric will have value, so you will have to determine which metrics make sense for the project. For example, measuring how many meetings the software engineers on your project attend on a weekly basis may not be the most valuable metric for a productivity goal. Alternatively, you might measure other aspects of the engineers’ productivity, such as a particular number of features created per engineer or a specific number of issues flagged per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Attainable\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal can be reasonably reached based on the metrics? Typically, you want goals that are a little challenging to encourage growth. Otherwise, what's the point of the goal if nothing's going to change? However, you don't want it to be too extreme or you'll never reach it. You'll have failed before you even started. Aim to find a balance between the two extremes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's take the goal to run a 5K. Say you regularly run 2.5 kilometers three times a week. An attainable goal would be to go from running 2.5 kilometers to running five kilometers within four weeks. An unattainable goal might be earning first-place in a 5K.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relevant\n",
    "\n",
    "Does it make sense to try and reach this goal? Think about how the goal lines up with other goals, priorities, and values. Ask whether the goal seems worthwhile. Does the effort involved balance out the benefits? Does it match your organization's other needs and priorities? Everyone from the client and the project team and the people who will ultimately use the product need to feel like the goal is worth supporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time-bound\n",
    "\n",
    "Time-bound means your goal has a deadline. Deadlines give you a way to track your progress. Otherwise, you may never reach your goal or never even get started. Time and metrics often go hand in hand, because time can also be used as a metric. Making your goal time-bound gives you a way to break down how much needs to be accomplished over time."

    "\n",
    "In order of importance, those factors are:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. __Psychological safety__: An individual's perception of the consequences of taking an interpersonal risk. In other words, they believe it is safe to take risks within the team and they don't risk being labeled as ignorant, incompetent, negative or disruptive.\n",
    " \n",
    " On teams with high psychological safety, teammates feel comfortable taking risks around fellow team members, seeking differing opinions and resolving interpersonal conflict when it comes up: \"__Be direct _and_ kind__\".\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. __Dependability__: On dependable teams, members are reliable and complete their work on time. Creating a dependable team requires the combination of setting, negotiating and meeting expectations. The team needs to meet the expectations set for them.\n",
    " \n",
    " As a project manager, you need to establish a two way relationship with your team. You have to be able to clearly communicate expectations and ensure that the team feels comfortable negotiating with you when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. __Structure and clarity__: Structure and clarity refers to an individual's understanding of job expectations, knowledge of how to meet those expectations and the consequences of their performance. Each team member has a clear sense of their individual role, plans and goals. And they have a sense of how their work affects the group.\n",
    "\n",
    " As a project manager, you can help foster a sense of structure and clarity on the team. For example, if a project structure in tracking are sloppy, unorganized and incohesive, then the team's output is likely to be sloppy, unorganized and incohesive. This can cause tension within the team. Alternatively, if you diligently engage in project tracking, your team will have clarity, feel more united and will be able to effectively collaborate.\n",
    "\n",
    " 4. __Meaning__: Finding a sense of purpose either in the work itself or in the results of that work. For example, your teammates might find meaning in supporting themselves financially, helping the team reach its goals or wanting their products to reach a new community of users.\n",
    "\n",
    " 5. __Impact__: The belief that the results of one's work matters and creates change. It can be challenging for people to notice how their work can shift an entire ecosystem forward. Part of your role as the project manager, is to help individual teammates identify how they drive impact both within the team and beyond it.\n",

And you may even decide to use more than one.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips for selecting a tracking method\n",

    "\n",
    " * Helping a team stay on schedule.\n",
    " * Projects with lots of tasks, dependencies, and milestones.\n",
    " * Projects with large teams, because ownership and responsibilities are explicitly laid out visually.\n",

    "Roadmaps are another common tracking method. Like Gantt charts, Roadmaps also track both individual and project progress toward milestones. However, Roadmaps are best suited for tracking big milestones in your project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Roadmaps are useful for:\n",
    "\n",
    " * High-level tracking of large milestones. Roadmaps outline the project as a whole and provide an overall snapshot of key points—just like an actual roadmap contains points of interest and mile markers.\n",
    " * Illustrating to your team or key stakeholders how a project should evolve over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Burndown charts are typically used by Agile Scrum teams. Burndown charts reveal how quickly your team is working by displaying how much work is left and how much time remains to complete the work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main uses of a Burndown chart are to keep the project team on top of targeted completion dates and make them aware of scope creep if it occurs. The chart should be displayed so everyone can see it and needs to be updated regularly in order to be effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Burndown charts are useful for:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Projects that require a detailed review of tasks.\n",
    " * Projects where finishing on time is the top priority.\n",
