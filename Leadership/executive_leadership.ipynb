    "# The Two Principles\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Principle 1: Earn Trust\n",
    "\n",
    "Trust is believing that a person will do what you expect them to do. However, it also tends to mean that the person we trust will act with our best interests in mind. As an executive, it is important that you remember that trust is a key to success. People will follow you during times of uncertainty and will be more willing to accept change when they trust you. So, work to build trust every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earning trust every day is the foundation of successful executive leadership. Whether they say it or not, a question on everyone’s mind is “Why should we follow you?” The best answer is “Because we trust you.”\n",
    "\n",
    "We trust you to look out for our best interest, to help us succeed, empower us to reach our goals, and do more than we thought we could. To help us be proud of the meaningful work we’ve done. But there’s only one way to gain it and keep it, and that’s to earn it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do this everyday and you will build strong trust:\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Reliability__: be someone who can be counted on. Show up on time, be prepared, and over-deliver. Make commitments and follow through. Close the loop on all expectations. If sometimes you fall short, do whatever it takes to make it right.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Credibility__: Bring value to the table. Know what you are supposed to know and do what you are supposed to do. Learn all about your business and industry. Step up when you are needed. Make your presence felt and add value.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Connection__: build rapport and relationship with others. Learn something from them or about them every time you interact. Find out what matters to them and help them get it. Listen, understand, and give. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Principle 2: Serve Your People\n",
    "\n",
    "The heart of executive leadership is in two words, “serving others.” Orient your personal compass to serving\n",
    "others and your impact will be far-reaching.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of my favorite role models I spoke to in my research is Mike Critelli, the former CEO of postal service giant\n",

    "# The Two Principles\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Principle 1: Earn Trust\n",
    "\n",
    "Trust is believing that a person will do what you expect them to do. However, it also tends to mean that the person we trust will act with our best interests in mind. As an executive, it is important that you remember that trust is a key to success. People will follow you during times of uncertainty and will be more willing to accept change when they trust you. So, work to build trust every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earning trust every day is the foundation of successful executive leadership. Whether they say it or not, a question on everyone’s mind is “Why should we follow you?” The best answer is “Because we trust you.”\n",
    "\n",
    "We trust you to look out for our best interest, to help us succeed, empower us to reach our goals, and do more than we thought we could. To help us be proud of the meaningful work we’ve done. But there’s only one way to gain it and keep it, and that’s to earn it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do this everyday and you will build strong trust:\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Reliability__: be someone who can be counted on. Show up on time, be prepared, and over-deliver. Make commitments and follow through. Close the loop on all expectations. If sometimes you fall short, do whatever it takes to make it right.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Credibility__: Bring value to the table. Know what you are supposed to know and do what you are supposed to do. Learn all about your business and industry. Step up when you are needed. Make your presence felt and add value.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Connection__: build rapport and relationship with others. Learn something from them or about them every time you interact. Find out what matters to them and help them get it. Listen, understand, and give. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Principle 2: Serve Your People\n",
    "\n",
    "The heart of executive leadership is in two words, “serving others.” Orient your personal compass to serving\n",
    "others and your impact will be far-reaching.\n",
