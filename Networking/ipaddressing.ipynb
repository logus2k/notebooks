The result of this process is that routes to many customers will be aggregated together, and will appear to other providers as a single route.\n",

    "IPv4 address space is nearly exhausted. However, ISPs must continue to support IPv4 growth until IPv6 is fully deployed. To that end, many ISPs will deploy a Carrier-Grade NAT (CGN) device, such as that described in RFC 6264. Because CGNs are used on networks where public address space is expected, and currently available private address space causes operational issues when used in this context, ISPs require a new IPv4 /10 address block. This address block will be called the \"Shared Address Space\" and will be used to number the interfaces that connect CGN devices to Customer Premises Equipment (CPE).\n",
    "\n",
    "Shared Address Space is similar to RFC 1918 private address space in that it is not globally routable address space and can be used by multiple pieces of equipment. However, Shared Address Space has limitations in its use that the current RFC 1918 private address space does not have. In particular, Shared Address Space can only be used in Service Provider networks or on routing equipment that is able to do address translation across router interfaces when the addresses are identical on two different interfaces.\n",

    "Subnetting is the process of dividing a single large network into multiple small networks known as subnets. The primary purpose of subnetting is to help relieve network congestion and improve efficiency in the utilization of the relatively small network address space available especially in IPv4.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two approaches to subnetting an IP address for a network: Fixed Length Subnet Mask (FLSM) and Variable-Length Subnet Mask (VLSM). In FLSM subnetting, all subnets are of equal size with an equal number of host identifiers. You use the same subnet mask for each subnet, and all the subnets have the same number of addresses in them. It tends to be the most wasteful because it uses more IP addresses than are necessary.\n",

    "VLSM is a subnet design strategy that allows all subnet masks to have variable sizes. In VLSM subnetting, network administrators can divide an IP address space into subnets of different sizes, and allocate it according to the individual need on a network. This type of subnetting makes more efficient use of a given IP address range. VLSM is the defacto standard for how every network is designed today.
