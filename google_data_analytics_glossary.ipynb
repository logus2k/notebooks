    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis is the process used to make sense of the data collected. It means taking the right steps to proceed and think about your data in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of analysis is to identify trends and relationships within the data so that you can accurately answer the question you're asking.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four phases of analysis are:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. __Organize data__: It is super important that you keep your data organized throughout your analysis. How your data is classified and structured will impact your findings, whether you're working in a spreadsheet or a database. Most of the data you'll use in your analysis will be organized in tables.\n",
    " \n",
    " Tables help you organize similar kinds of data into categories and subject areas that you can focus on as you analyze. Each table then has several fields of data, like branch owner and the cost of repair parts. You can use these tables and fields to help you decide how to move forward with your analysis. The structure of this database can help you decide which data you need to pull to meet your objectives. For example, the total number of a particular brand of car sold, or a repair part for a specific make and model of a car at a certain branch.\n",
    "\n",
    " Tables also allow you to make decisions about data types. They help you to figure out what variables you need and the data type those variables should have.\n",
    " \n",
    " 2. __Format and adjust data__: formatting data streamlines things and saves time. Scrolling through hundreds of gifts can be time-consuming. Instead, you can adjust the data in a way that makes it easy to digest by filtering and sorting it.\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. __Get input from others__: When analyzing data, gaining input from others is important because it gives you a viewpoint you might not understand or have access to. On top of gaining input from other people, it's also important to seek out others' perspectives early. That way, if they predict any obstacles or challenges, you'll know beforehand. The people you'll look to for input don't have to be experts to be helpful. Sometimes all you need is for someone who's familiar with a topic or data you're considering.\n",
    " \n",
    " 4. __Transform data__: Transforming data means identifying relationships and patterns between the data, and making calculations based on the data you have."

    "# Analytical Skills\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Analytical skills are qualities and characteristics associated with using facts to solve problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there are a lot of aspects to analytical skills, it is possible to summarize on five essential points:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Curiosity\n",
    "\n",
    "Curiosity is all about wanting to learn something. Curious people usually seek out new challenges and experiences. This leads to knowledge. The very fact that you're here with me right now demonstrates that you have curiosity. That was an easy one.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding context\n",
    "\n",
    "Context is the condition in which something exists or happens. This can be a structure or an environment. Listening and trying to understand the full picture is critical. In your own life, you put things into context all the time. For example, think about your grocery list. If you group together items like flour, sugar, and yeast, that's you adding context to your groceries. This saves you time when you're at the baking aisle at the grocery store. Let's look at another example. Have you ever shuffled a deck of cards and noticed the joker? If you're playing a game that doesn't include jokers, identifying that card means you understand it's out of context. Remove it, and you're much more likely to play a successful game.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Having a technical mindset\n",
    "\n",
    "A technical mindset involves the ability to break things down into smaller steps or pieces and work with them in an orderly and logical way. For instance, when paying your bills, you probably already break down the process into smaller steps. Maybe you start by sorting them by the date they're due. Next, you might add them up and compare that amount to the balance in your bank account. This would help you see if you can pay your bills now, or if you should wait until the next paycheck. Finally, you'd pay them. When you take something that seems like a single task, like paying your bills, and break it into smaller steps with an orderly process, that's using a technical mindset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data design\n",
    "\n",
    "Data design is how you organize information. As a data analyst, design typically has to do with an actual database. But, again, the same skills can easily be applied to everyday life. For example, think about the way you organize the contacts in your phone. That's actually a type of data design. Maybe you list them by first name instead of last, or maybe you use email addresses instead of their names. What you're really doing is designing a clear, logical list that lets you call or text a contact in a quick and simple way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Data strategy is the management of the people, processes, and tools used in data analysis. You manage people by making sure they know how to use the right data to find solutions to the problem you're working on. For processes, it's about making sure the path to that solution is clear and accessible. For tools, you make sure the right technology is being used for the job. Imagine mowing a lawn. Step 1 would be reading the owner's manual for the mower. That's making sure the people involved, or you, in this example, know how to use the data available. The manual would instruct you to put on protective eyewear and closed-toe shoes. Then, it's on to step 2: making the process, the path, clear and accessible. This will involve you walking around the lawn, picking up large sticks or rocks that might get in your way. Finally, for step 3, you check the lawn mower, your tool, to make sure it has enough gas and oil, and is in working condition, so the lawn can be mown safely."

    "Here are some benefits that come with big data:\n",
    "\n",
    " * When large amounts of data can be stored and analyzed, it can help companies identify more efficient ways of doing business and save a lot of time and money.\n",
    " * Big data helps organizations spot the trends of customer buying patterns and satisfaction levels, which can help them create new products and solutions that will make customers happy.\n",
    " * By analyzing big data, businesses get a much better understanding of current market conditions, which can help them stay ahead of the competition.\n",

The insights are used to define and create a more productive and empowering workplace. This can unlock employee potential, motivate people to perform at their best, and ensure a fair and inclusive company culture. \n",
    "\n",
    "The six steps of the data analysis process that you have been learning in this program are: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act. These six steps apply to any data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Data Analysis Process](images\\data_analysis_process.png \"Data Analysis Process\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Continue reading to learn how a team of people analysts used these six steps to answer a concrete business question. \n",
    "\n",
    "An organization was experiencing a high turnover rate among new hires. Many employees left the company before the end of their first year on the job. The analysts used the data analysis process to answer the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "_How can the organization improve the retention rate for new employees?_ \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s break down what this team did, step-by-step:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Ask](images\\ask.png \"Ask\")\n",
    "\n",
    "As data analysts, we need to be thinking about the type of data we need in order to answer the questions that we have set out to answer, based on what we learned when we asked the right questions, e.g. we need to be thinking about what type of data we need to answer the key questions. This could be anything from quantitative data or qualitative data. It could be cross-sectional, or points in time versus longitudinal over a long period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, the analysts needed to define what the project would look like and what would qualify as a successful result. To determine these things, they asked effective questions and collaborated with leaders and managers who were interested in the outcome of their people analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, as analysts in the Ask phase, we need do two things:\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Define the problem to be solved__\n",
    "\n",
    " Defining a problem means you look at the current state and identify how it's different from the ideal state. Usually there's an obstacle we need to get rid of or something wrong that needs to be fixed. For instance, a sports arena might want to reduce the time fans spend waiting in the ticket line. The obstacle is figuring out how to get the customers to their seats more quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Make sure that we fully understand stakeholder expectations__\n",
    "\n",
    " The first step here is to __determine who the stakeholders are__. That may include your manager, an executive sponsor, or your sales partners. There can be lots of stakeholders. But what they all have in common is that they help make decisions, influence actions and strategies, and have specific goals they want to meet. They also care about the project and that's why it's so important to understand their expectations. For instance, if your manager assigns you a data analysis project related to business risk, it would be smart to confirm whether they want to include all types of risks that could affect the company, or just risks related to weather such as hurricanes and tornadoes.\n",
    " \n",
    " __Communicating with your stakeholders__ is key in making sure you stay engaged and on track throughout the project. So as a data analyst, developing strong communication strategies is very important. This part of the ask phase helps you keep focused on the problem itself, not just its symptoms. The Five Whys are extremely helpful here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s impossible to solve a problem if you don’t know what it is. These are some things to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Define the problem you’re trying to solve \n",
    " * Make sure you fully understand the stakeholder’s expectations\n",
    " * Focus on the actual problem and avoid any distractions\n",
    " * Collaborate with stakeholders and keep an open line of communication\n",
    " * Take a step back and see the whole situation in context\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions to ask yourself in this step\n",
    "\n",
    " * What are my stakeholders saying their problems are?\n",
    " * Now that I’ve identified the issues, how can I help the stakeholders resolve their questions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, these are three relevant questions to ask at the beggining of every project:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Who are the primary and secondary stakeholders?\n",
    " 2. Who is managing the data?\n",
    " 3. Where can you go for help?\n",
    "\n",
    "![Prepare](images\\prepare.png \"Prepare\")\n",
    "\n",
    "It all started with solid preparation. The group built a timeline of three months and decided how they wanted to relay their progress to interested parties. Also during this step, the analysts identified what data they needed to achieve the successful result they identified in the previous step - in this case, the analysts chose to gather the data from a survey of new employees. They identified specific questions to ask about employee satisfaction with different business processes, such as hiring, onboarding, and compensation. Rules were established for who would have access to the data collected, what specific information would be gathered, and how best to present the data visually. The analysts brainstormed possible project - and data-related issues and how to avoid them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this phase, data analysts collect and store data they'll use for the upcoming analysis process. It is important that your data and results are objective and unbiased. In other words, any decisions made from your analysis should always be based on facts and be fair and impartial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "You will decide what data you need to collect in order to answer your questions and how to organize it so that it is useful. You might use your business task to decide: \n",
    "\n",

    "![Process](images\\process.png \"Process\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The group sent the survey out. Great analysts know how to respect both their data and the people who provide it. Since employees provided the data, it was important to make sure all employees gave their consent to participate. The data analysts also made sure employees understood how their data would be collected, stored, managed, and protected. In order to maintain confidentiality and protect and store the data effectively, access was restricted to a limited number of analysts. Collecting and using data ethically is one of the responsibilities of a data analyst. Then the data was cleaned up to make sure it was complete, correct, and relevant, and uploaded to an internal data warehouse for an additional layer of security.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the Process phase, data analysts find and eliminate any errors and inaccuracies that can get in the way of results. This usually means cleaning data, transforming it into a more useful format, combining two or more datasets to make information more complete and removing outliers, which are any data points that could skew the information. After that, you'll learn how to check the data you prepare to make sure it's complete and correct. This phase is all about getting the details right. So you'll also fix typos, inconsistencies, or missing and inaccurate data. To top it off, you'll gain strategies for verifying and sharing your data cleansing with stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Process phase is where you get a chance to understand the data structure, its quirks, its nuances, and you really get a chance to understand deeply what type of data you are going to be working with and understanding what potential the data has to answer all of your questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Clean data is the best data and you will need to clean up your data to get rid of any possible errors, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies. This might mean:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Using spreadsheet functions to find incorrectly entered data \n",
    " * Using SQL functions to check for extra spaces\n",
    " * Removing repeated entries\n",
    " * Checking as much as possible for bias in the data\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Analyze](images\\analyze.png \"Analyze\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the analysts did what they do best: analyze! From the completed surveys, the data analysts would discover that a new employee’s experience with the hiring process was a key indicator of overall job satisfaction. The analysts found that employees who experienced an efficient and transparent hiring process were most likely to remain with the company. Employees who experienced a long and complicated hiring process were most likely to leave the company. The group knew it was important to document exactly what they found in the analysis, no matter what the results. To do otherwise would decrease trust in the survey process and reduce their ability to collect truthful data from employees in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing the data you've collected involves using tools to transform and organize that information so that you can draw useful conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making. There are lots of powerful tools data analysts use in their work and that includes spreadsheets and Structured Query Language (SQL).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "You will want to think analytically about your data. At this stage, you might sort and format your data to make it easier to: \n",

    "\n",
    " * What story is my data telling me?\n",
    " * How will my data help me solve this problem?\n",
    " * Who needs my company’s product or service? What type of person is most likely to use it?\n",
    "\n",
    "![Share](images\\share.png \"Share\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as they made sure the data was carefully protected, the analysts were also careful sharing the report. For example, in order for a manager to receive the survey report, a minimum number of their team members had to have participated in the survey. The group presented the results to leaders first to make sure they had the full picture, then asked them to deliver the results to their teams. This gave leaders an opportunity to communicate the results with the right context and have productive team conversations about next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the share phase, visualization is a data analyst's best friend. Visualization is essential to getting others to understand what your data is telling you. With the right visuals, facts and figures become so much easier to see and complex concepts become easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone shares their results differently so be sure to summarize your results with clear and enticing visuals of your analysis using data viz tools like graphs or dashboards. This is your chance to show the stakeholders you have solved their problem and how you got there. Sharing will certainly help your team:  \n",
    "\n",
    " * Make better decisions\n",
    " * Make more informed decisions\n",
    " * Lead to stronger outcomes\n",
    " * Successfully communicate your findings\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions to ask yourself in this step\n",
    "\n",
    " * How can I make what I present to the stakeholders engaging and easy to understand?\n",
    " * What would help me understand this if I were the listener?\n",
    "\n",
    "![Act](images\\act.png \"Act\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The last stage of the process for the team of analysts was to work with leaders within their company and decide how best to implement changes and take actions based on the findings. The analysts recommended standardizing the hiring process for all new hires based on the most efficient and transparent hiring practices. A year later, the same survey was distributed to employees. Analysts anticipated that a comparison between the two sets of results would indicate that the action plan worked. Turns out, the changes improved the retention rate for new employees and the actions taken by leaders were successful!\n",
    "\n",
    "The Act phase is the exciting moment when the business takes all of the insights you, the data analyst, have provided and puts them to work in order to solve the original business problem.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Common Mistakes To Avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "### Not checking for spelling errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Misspellings can be as simple as typing or input errors. Most of the time the wrong spelling or common grammatical errors can be detected, but it gets harder with things like names or addresses. For example, if you are working with a spreadsheet table of customer data, you might come across a customer named “John” whose name has been input incorrectly as “Jon” in some places. The spreadsheet’s spellcheck probably won’t flag this, so if you don’t double-check for spelling errors and catch this, your analysis will have mistakes in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forgetting to document errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Documenting your errors can be a big time saver, as it helps you avoid those errors in the future by showing you how you resolved them. For example, let’s say you find an error in a formula in your spreadsheet. You discover that some of the dates in one of your columns haven’t been formatted correctly. If you make a note of this fix, you can reference it the next time your formula is broken, and get a head start on troubleshooting. Documenting your errors also helps you keep track of changes in your work, so that you can backtrack if a fix didn’t work. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Not checking for misfielded values\n",
    "\n",
    "A misfielded value happens when the values are entered into the wrong field. These values might still be formatted correctly, which makes them harder to catch if you aren’t careful. For example, you might have a dataset with columns for cities and countries. These are the same type of data, so they are easy to mix up. But if you were trying to find all of the instances of Spain in the country column, and Spain had mistakenly been entered into the city column, you would miss key data points. Making sure your data has been entered correctly is key to accurate, complete analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Overlooking missing values\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing values in your dataset can create errors and give you inaccurate conclusions. For example, if you were trying to get the total number of sales from the last three months, but a week of transactions were missing, your calculations would be inaccurate.  As a best practice, try to keep your data as clean as possible by maintaining completeness and consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Only looking at a subset of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to think about all of the relevant data when you are cleaning. This helps make sure you understand the whole story the data is telling, and that you are paying attention to all possible errors. For example, if you are working with data about bird migration patterns from different sources, but you only clean one source, you might not realize that some of the data is being repeated. This will cause problems in your analysis later on. If you want to avoid common errors like duplicates, each field of your data requires equal attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Losing track of business objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are cleaning data, you might make new and interesting discoveries about your dataset-- but you don’t want those discoveries to distract you from the task at hand. For example, if you were working with weather data to find the average number of rainy days in your city, you might notice some interesting patterns about snowfall, too. That is really interesting, but it isn’t related to the question you are trying to answer right now. Being curious is great! But try not to let it distract you from the task at hand.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Not fixing the source of the error\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixing the error itself is important. But if that error is actually part of a bigger problem, you need to find the source of the issue. Otherwise, you will have to keep fixing that same error over and over again. For example, imagine you have a team spreadsheet that tracks everyone’s progress. The table keeps breaking because different people are entering different values. You can keep fixing all of these problems one by one, or you can set up your table to streamline data entry so everyone is on the same page. Addressing the source of the errors in your data will save you a lot of time in the long run. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Not analyzing the system prior to data cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to clean our data and avoid future errors, we need to understand the root cause of your dirty data. Imagine you are an auto mechanic. You would find the cause of the problem before you started fixing the car, right? The same goes for data. First, you figure out where the errors come from. Maybe it is from a data entry error, not setting up a spell check, lack of formats, or from duplicates. Then, once you understand where bad data comes from, you can control it and keep your data clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Not backing up your data prior to data cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "It is always good to be proactive and create your data backup before you start your data clean-up. If your program crashes, or if your changes cause a problem in your dataset, you can always go back to the saved version and restore it. The simple procedure of backing up your data can save you hours of work-- and most importantly, a headache. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Not accounting for data cleaning in your deadlines/process\n",

    "These are relevant considerations regarding data collection:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Select the right data type: As you collect data, you'll also want to make sure you select the right data type. For example, considering traffic data, an appropriate data type could be the dates of traffic records stored in a date format. The dates could help you figure what days of the week there is likely to be a high volume of traffic in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Determine the timeframe for data collection: If you are collecting your own data, decide how long you will need to collect it, especially if you are tracking trends over a long period of time. If you need an immediate answer, you might not have time to collect new data. In this case, you would need to use historical data that already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    " * How the data will be collected: decide if you will collect the data using your own resources or receive (and possibly purchase it) from another party. Data that you collect yourself is called first-party data.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * How much data to collect: if you are collecting your own data, make reasonable decisions about sample size. A random sample from existing data might be fine for some projects. Other projects might need more strategic data collection to focus on certain criteria. Each project has its own needs.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Choose data sources: if you don’t collect the data using your own resources (first-party data), you might get data from second-party or third-party data providers. Second-party data is collected directly by another group and then sold. Third-party data is sold by a provider that didn’t collect the data themselves. Third-party data might come from a number of different sources.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Decide what data to use: datasets can show a lot of interesting information. But be sure to choose data that can actually help solve your problem question. For example, if you are analyzing trends over time, make sure you use time series data — in other words, data that includes dates."

    "\n",
    "If you have incomplete or nonexistent data, you might realize during an analysis that you don't have enough data to reach a conclusion. Or, you might even be solving a different problem altogether! For example, suppose you are looking for employees who earned a particular certificate but discover that certification records go back only two years at your company. You can still use the data, but you will need to make the limits of your analysis clear. You might be able to find an alternate source of the data by contacting the company that led the training. But to be safe, you should be up front about the incomplete dataset until that data becomes available.\n",

    "## Don't miss misaligned data\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're collecting data from other teams and using existing spreadsheets, it is good to keep in mind that people use different business rules. So one team might define and measure things in a completely different way than another. For example, if a metric is the total number of trainees in a certificate program, you could have one team that counts every person who registered for the training, and another team that counts only the people who completed the program. In cases like these, establishing how to measure things early on standardizes the data across the board for greater reliability and accuracy. This will make sure comparisons between teams are meaningful and insightful.\n",

    "Dirty data refers to data that contains errors. Dirty data can lead to productivity loss, unnecessary spending, and unwise decision-making. A good data cleaning effort can help you avoid this. As a quick reminder, data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset. When you find and fix the errors - while tracking the changes you made - you can avoid a data disaster. You will learn how to clean data later in the training.\n",

    " * Visualize with care: A 0.01% drop in a score can look huge if you zoom in close enough. To make sure your audience sees the full story clearly, it is a good idea to set your Y-axis to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Leave out needless graphs: If a table can show your story at a glance, stick with the table instead of a pie chart or a graph. Your busy audience will appreciate the clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Test for statistical significance: Sometimes two datasets will look different, but you will need a way to test whether the difference is real and important. So remember to run statistical tests to see how much confidence you can place in that difference.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Pay attention to sample size: Gather lots of data. If a sample size is small, a few unusual responses can skew the results. If you find that you have too little data, be careful about using it to form judgments. Look for opportunities to collect more data, then chart those trends over longer periods.\n",

    "\n",
    "In any organization, a big part of a data analyst’s role is making sound judgments. When you know the limitations of your data, you can make judgment calls that help people make better decisions supported by the data. Data is an extremely powerful tool for decision-making, but if it is incomplete, misaligned, or hasn’t been cleaned, then it can be misleading. Take the necessary steps to make sure that your data is complete and consistent. Clean the data before you begin your analysis to save yourself and possibly others a great amount of time and effort."

    "\n",
    "A company that wants to know the best advertising method to bring in new customers is an example of a problem requiring analysts to make predictions. Analysts with data on location, type of media, and number of new customers acquired as a result of past ads can't guarantee future results, but they can help predict the best placement of advertising to reach the target audience.\n",

    "An example of a problem requiring analysts to categorize things is a company's goal to improve customer satisfaction. Analysts might classify customer service calls based on certain keywords or scores. This could help identify top-performing customer service representatives or help correlate certain actions taken with higher customer satisfaction scores.\n",

    "For example, how a smart watch can find a peak in a resting heartbeat rate of a person.\n",

    "A company that sells smart watches that help people monitor their health would be interested in designing their software to spot something unusual. Analysts who have analyzed aggregated health data can help product developers determine the right algorithms to spot and set off alarms when certain data doesn't trend normally.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Identifying themes\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, how to improve a coffee maker customers' interaction with their products.\n",
    "\n",
    "User experience (UX) designers might rely on analysts to analyze user interaction data. Similar to problems that require analysts to categorize things, usability improvement projects might require analysts to identify themes to help prioritize the right product features for improvement. Themes are most often used to help researchers explore certain aspects of data. In a user study, user beliefs, practices, and needs are examples of themes. \n",

    "By now you might be wondering if there is a difference between categorizing things and identifying themes, The best way to think about it is this: Categorizing things involves assigning items to categories. Identifying themes takes those categories a step further by grouping them into broader themes.\n",

    "## Discovering connections\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, how to reduce wait time of truck drivers when they pick up a shipment.\n",
    "\n",
    "A third-party logistics company working with another company to get shipments delivered to customers on time is a problem requiring analysts to discover connections. By analyzing the wait times at shipping hubs, analysts can determine the appropriate schedule changes to increase the number of on-time deliveries. \n",
