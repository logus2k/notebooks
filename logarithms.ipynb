    "# LOGARITHMS\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics, the logarithm is the inverse function to exponentiation. That means the logarithm of a given number $x$ is the exponent to which another fixed number, the base $b$, must be raised, to produce that number $x$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\large b^{x} = y\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, exponentiation allows any positive real number as base to be raised to any real power, always producing a positive result, so $\\log_{b}(x)$ for any two positive real numbers $b$ and $x$, where $b$ is not equal to $1$, is always a unique real number $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "More explicitly, the defining relation between exponentiation and logarithm is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\large \\log_{b}(x) = y$ exactly if $\\large b^{y} = x$ and $\\large x > 0$ and $\\large b > 0$ and $\\large b \\ne 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among all choices for the base, three are particularly common. Those are $b = 10$, $b = e$ (the irrational mathematical constant $\\approx 2.718281828459$), and $b = 2$ (the binary logarithm):\n",
    "\n",
    "![Graphs of several logarithms](images\\logarithms.png \"Graphs of several logarithms\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Logarithms are useful for solving equations in which the unknown appears as the exponent of some other quantity. For example, logarithms are used to solve for the half-life, decay constant, or unknown time in exponential decay problems. They are important in many branches of mathematics and scientific disciplines, and are used in finance to solve problems involving compound interest."

    "There is the exponential form, and there is the logarithmic form, and both forms capture the same idea, which is the relationship between three numbers: a base, an exponent, and the result value.\n",

    "\n",
    "The logarithm of $x$ to base $b$ is denoted as $\\log_{b}(x)$, or without parentheses, $\\log_{b} x$, or even without the explicit base, $\\log_{} x$, when no confusion is possible, or when the base does not matter, such as in big $O$ notation.\n",
