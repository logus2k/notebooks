    "In probability theory and statistics, Bayes's theorem, named after Reverend Thomas Bayes (also known as \"Bayes's law\" or \"Bayes's rule\"), describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to that event.\n",

    "### Lagrange\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lagrange's notation, the derivative of $f$ is expressed as $f'$ (pronounced \"_$f$ prime_\").\n",
    "\n",
    "This notation is probably the most common when dealing with functions with a single variable. If, instead of a function, we have an equation such as $y = f(x)$, we can also write $y'$ to represent the derivative. This, however, is less common to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Leibniz\n",
    "\n",
    "In Leibniz's notation, the derivative of $f$ is expressed as $\\dfrac{d}{dx}f(x)$. When we have an equation such as $y = f(x)$, we can express the derivative as $\\dfrac{dy}{dx}$. Here, $\\dfrac{d}{dx}$ serves as an operator that indicates a differentiation with respect to $x$. This notation also allows us to directly express the derivative of an expression without using a function or a dependent variable. For example, the derivative of $x^2$ can be expressed as $\\dfrac{d}{dx}(x^2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notation, while less comfortable than Lagrange's notation, becomes very useful when dealing with integral calculus, differential equations, and multivariable calculus.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Newton\n",
    "\n",
    "In Newton's notation, the derivative of $f$ is expressed as $\\dot{f}$ and the derivative of $y = f(x)$ is expressed as $\\dot{y}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notation is mostly common in Physics and other sciences where calculus is applied in a real-world context.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Derivatives are the result of performing a differentiation process upon a function or an expression. The derivative of a function of a real variable measures the sensitivity to change of the function value (output value) with respect to a change in its argument (input value).\n",
    "\n",
    "Derivatives are a fundamental tool of Calculus. For example, the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to time is the object's velocity: it measures how quickly the position of the object changes when time advances.\n",
    "\n",
    "The derivative of a function of a single variable at a chosen input value, when it exists, is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point. The tangent line is the best linear approximation of the function near that input value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, the derivative is often described as the \"instantaneous rate of change\", the ratio of the instantaneous change in the dependent variable (the $y$-axis on a graph) to that of the independent variable (the $x$-axis on a graph).\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of finding a derivative is called \"differentiation\". The reverse process is called \"antidifferentiation\". The fundamental theorem of calculus relates antidifferentiation with integration. Differentiation and integration constitute the two fundamental operations in single-variable calculus.\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics and computer algebra, automatic differentiation, also called algorithmic differentiation, computational differentiation, auto-differentiation, or simply _autodiff_, is a set of techniques to numerically evaluate the derivative of a function specified by a computer program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic differentiation exploits the fact that every computer program, no matter how complicated, executes a sequence of elementary arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.) and elementary functions ($exp$, $log$, $sin$, $cos$, etc.). By applying the chain rule (a formula to compute the derivative of a composite function) repeatedly to these operations, derivatives of arbitrary order can be computed automatically, accurately to working precision, and using at most a small constant factor more arithmetic operations than the original program.\n",
